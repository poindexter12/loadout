# Changelog

One section per release window. Each window is a single commit on `main` that moves every
changed plugin at once, tagged `v<marketplace version>`, with matching per-plugin changelogs
under `plugins/<name>/CHANGELOG.md`.

Releases before v3.208.0 predate this file and are not backfilled; `git log` is the record for
those. Entries are generated from `.release/unreleased/*.md` by `scripts/release/cut.mjs`, so
nothing here is hand-written.

## v3.536.0 (2026-09-09)

### sidequest 5.0.40 → 5.0.41

#### Fixes

- Keep Sidequest release tests within budget (SQ-2596)
  Sidequest release verification now clears submission fixtures between cases, removing the stale Git resolution work that caused the functional phase to hit its eight-minute timeout.

### sidequest 5.0.39 → 5.0.40

#### Fixes

- Let accepted repairs bypass rejected candidate overlap (SQ-2585)

## v3.534.0 (2026-09-09)

### model-gateway 0.50.4 → 0.50.5

#### Fixes

- Correct Model Gateway documentation (SQ-2532)
  Align Model Gateway documentation with the Claude Code picker version gate, Astra proxy support, and the 325000 context cap's 292000 compaction point.

### observability 0.7.28 → 0.7.29

#### Fixes

- Correct observability documentation claims (SQ-2533)
  Correct observability documentation for disable behavior, automatic retention pruning, and separate verifier metric and observer-health results.

### quartermaster 0.7.6 → 0.7.7

#### Fixes

- Correct Quartermaster maintenance guidance (SQ-2534)
  Use the namespaced Quartermaster commands and document Live Rules reinjection cadence accurately.

### sidequest 5.0.38 → 5.0.39

#### Fixes

- Shared-tree writers no longer release over staged paths that pre-dated their dispatch (SQ-2530)
- Align Sidequest publish guidance with shipped behavior (SQ-2531) [`6e6a4f5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6e6a4f5d0faf0b78454a3e968b3c7a242507a7cb)
- Ignore pre-existing shared-tree dirt during executor delivery (SQ-2538)

## v3.533.0 (2026-09-08)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.7 → 2.15.8

#### Fixes

- Align Live Rules and Codebase Mapper docs with automation (SQ-2515)
  Document atomic Live Rules storage, migration and seen-hash injection cadence. Clarify automatic map assessment, no-op handling, optional Sidequest handoff and standalone fallback.
- Sync skill-text assertions after the documentation reword (SQ-2522)
  Test-only: the handoff and updater skill assertions now match the reworded prose without weakening the contract they check.

### live-rules 2.10.4 → 2.10.5

#### Fixes

- Align Live Rules and Codebase Mapper docs with automation (SQ-2515)
  Document atomic Live Rules storage, migration and seen-hash injection cadence. Clarify automatic map assessment, no-op handling, optional Sidequest handoff and standalone fallback.

### model-gateway 0.50.3 → 0.50.4

#### Fixes

- Fix gateway and observability setup guidance (SQ-2514)
  Clarify gateway onboarding, model visibility recovery, local record controls, and observability setup, privacy, recovery, retention, and pricing guidance.
- Declare a 300s suite timeout for the gateway tests (SQ-2529)
  Declare `suiteTimeout` for the Model Gateway test suite so its process-isolation tests get the same five-minute file budget the observability suite already has; the suite spawns and retires real gateway processes and can exceed two minutes on a busy machine.

### observability 0.7.27 → 0.7.28

#### Fixes

- Fix gateway and observability setup guidance (SQ-2514)
  Clarify gateway onboarding, model visibility recovery, local record controls, and observability setup, privacy, recovery, retention, and pricing guidance.

### quartermaster 0.7.5 → 0.7.6

#### Fixes

- Clarify Quartermaster setup and privacy guidance (SQ-2512)
  Clarifies the guided setup handoff, registry-wide update scope, bounded session-summary privacy boundary, and maintenance reload rules.
- Sync skill-text assertions after the documentation reword (SQ-2522)
  Test-only: the handoff and updater skill assertions now match the reworded prose without weakening the contract they check.

### sidequest 5.0.37 → 5.0.38

#### Fixes

- Align Sidequest lifecycle guidance (SQ-2513)
  Align Sidequest lifecycle guidance, recovery instructions, and human workflow docs with the shipped behavior.
- Allow owned helper evidence writes (SQ-2518)
  Helpers admitted to an active ticket can write that ticket's board-owned verification evidence without widening repository scope. Evidence for other tickets and escaped paths stays blocked.
- Reject foreign evidence aliases (SQ-2520)
  Sidequest now refuses helper writes that reach another ticket's board-owned verification evidence through a scratchpad junction.
- Sync MCP descriptor golden and skill byte budget (SQ-2523)
  Regenerate the MCP tool descriptor golden after the lifecycle guidance reword shortened two field descriptions, and trim the sidequest skill back under its session-load byte budget.

## v3.532.0 (2026-09-08)

### sidequest 5.0.36 → 5.0.37

#### Fixes

- Start read-only research without an initial Git commit (SQ-2517) [`67d20f1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/67d20f1c1466ba1f8a1b767e86446a672accef2d)

## v3.531.0 (2026-09-08)

### sidequest 5.0.35 → 5.0.36

#### Fixes

- Fix executor launch after plugin reload (SQ-2509) [`756abee`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/756abeee210ba3f79c84694beed228cb907e4ef9)

## v3.530.0 (2026-09-08)

### sidequest 5.0.34 → 5.0.35

#### Fixes

- Preserve ticket delivery branch targets (SQ-2504)
  Ticket delivery and abandonment now keep the integration target recorded at dispatch when the board target or checkout later changes.

## v3.529.0 (2026-09-08)

### observability 0.7.26 → 0.7.27

#### Fixes

- Keep Astra costs in provisioned dashboards (SQ-2503)
  The newest running observer now prevents older open sessions from replacing current provisioned dashboards during downstream health failures.

### sidequest 5.0.33 → 5.0.34

#### Fixes

- Keep local board references out of GitHub updates (SQ-2500)

## v3.528.0 (2026-09-08)

### sidequest 5.0.32 → 5.0.33

#### Fixes

- Bundle Sidequest executors for reliable first-install agent discovery (SQ-2499)

## v3.527.0 (2026-09-07)

### observability 0.7.25 → 0.7.26

#### Fixes

- Price Astra in Grafana cost panels (SQ-2497)

## v3.526.0 (2026-09-07)

### observability 0.7.24 → 0.7.25

#### Fixes

- Show unpriced model usage (SQ-2496)
  Show token volumes for models without published API pricing in the Grafana dashboard, while keeping cost totals clearly scoped to priced models.

## v3.525.0 (2026-09-07)

### quartermaster 0.7.4 → 0.7.5

#### Fixes

- Recommend a consistent Codex compaction window (SQ-2493) [`2994017`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2994017d5dc91ffc86c309589dbfbc8b7cf0cacb)

### sidequest 5.0.31 → 5.0.32

#### Fixes

- Working-tree dispatch preserves unrecordable dirty baselines (SQ-2492)

## v3.524.0 (2026-09-07)

### sidequest 5.0.30 → 5.0.31

#### Fixes

- Fan out unpinnable contract investigations (SQ-2490) [`351ca52`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/351ca52ee3bf611e51741c38f94c6315deb7b1ee)

## v3.523.0 (2026-09-07)

### model-gateway 0.50.2 → 0.50.3

#### Fixes

- Wait for gateway test fixture teardown (SQ-2488) [`ab71e12`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ab71e12eb186363e04780df8a3e4a7696dff7974)

### quartermaster 0.7.3 → 0.7.4

#### Fixes

- Refresh marketplace freshness at Stop time (SQ-2489)

## v3.522.0 (2026-09-06)

### model-gateway 0.50.1 → 0.50.2

#### Fixes

- Wait for fixture gateway shutdown (SQ-2482)
  Model Gateway test fixtures now wait for the supervisor, worker, and pid-record writes before removing their temporary home.
- ensure keeps live sibling-version gateway records instead of logging them as stale pid files (SQ-2483)
  After an upgrade, `ensure` reported the live worker and proxy as stale pid files even though it had just started them. The ownership probe now recognizes a live gateway process from a sibling install version, so the records survive and the stale-pid line only appears for processes that are gone.
- preserve live proxy records when Windows reports a physical path spelling (SQ-2486)
  `ensure` now resolves the proxy executable path before deciding whether a live pid record belongs to this gateway. This keeps a shared proxy record when Windows reports the command with an equivalent physical path spelling.
- restart sibling gateway processes on Linux without lsof (SQ-2487)
  `ensure` now finds listening Linux processes through `/proc` when `lsof` is unavailable, so it can replace an older sibling gateway before launching its replacement.

### sidequest 5.0.29 → 5.0.30

#### Fixes

- Accept threaded negative-control test markers (SQ-2484)
  Sidequest now accepts claim-holder negative-control test markers posted anywhere on the ticket thread and names the markers it found when evidence is incomplete.

## v3.521.0 (2026-09-06)

### model-gateway 0.50.0 → 0.50.1

#### Fixes

- Keep shared proxy ownership tied to its supervisor (SQ-2474)
  Model Gateway now refuses to stop a shared proxy binary unless the live process tree proves it was launched by the recovering supervisor.
- Replace older Model Gateway shims on upgrade (SQ-2479)
  Model Gateway upgrades now replace an older cached sibling shim while leaving genuinely foreign installs alone.
- Refuse foreign Model Gateway cache junctions (SQ-2481)
  Model Gateway now leaves foreign installs alone when their process path passes through a cache junction or symlink.

## v3.520.0 (2026-09-06)

### model-gateway 0.49.0 → 0.50.0

#### Features

- Refresh OAuth model discovery cache (SQ-2439)
- Give Codex models a full client context window (SQ-2440)
  Codex picker and Sidequest catalog models now use Claude Code's `[1m]` alias so sessions avoid the 200k unknown-model compaction window while Model Gateway keeps the verified backend limit and headroom.

#### Fixes

- Record gateway lifecycle evidence (SQ-2446)
- Isolate gateway test fixtures (SQ-2448)
  Gateway test processes now use isolated user state, sockets, ports, caches, logs, and proxy settings.
- Keep SessionStart gateway startup outside hook cleanup (SQ-2452)
  Launcher source: Kenny's inline fix (`0c1133432b801e0ca6666d8fa4565c44d5f6f614`).
- Stabilize stale-pin fixture (SQ-2454)
  The stale-pin regression fixture now isolates fake Claude attempt counters per alias, preventing parallel probes from overwriting each other's state.
- Scope gateway supervisor cleanup (SQ-2455)
  Gateway cleanup now only acts on the configured install's recorded processes, so isolated test runs leave the installed gateway alone.
- Wait for isolated gateway fixture cleanup (SQ-2458)
  Fixes isolated model-gateway test cleanup by waiting for tracked supervisor processes to exit after signaling them. The Linux failure was a cleanup race, not a production stop-path or zombie-detection issue.
- Protect foreign gateway processes (SQ-2460)
  Model Gateway now verifies process ownership before stopping a proxy, reaping recorded PIDs, or asking a shim to restart. Stale PID files are removed and reported without stopping a reused process.
- Centralize gateway model window policy (SQ-2467)
  Model Gateway now uses one policy table for advertised windows, `[1m]` aliases, and routing. Grok 4.5 gets its 500k picker alias, while unmeasured Codex rows use an explicit documented default.
- Show model window policy in doctor (SQ-2469)
  Show every active model's context-window policy in doctor and flag a shim whose picker ids are stale.
- Keep gateway recovery probes tied to the supervisor (SQ-2476)
  Model Gateway now bounds ownership probes during proxy recovery, kills their child trees with the supervisor, and waits for them to close so a timed probe cannot hold a fixture home open.
- Derive and log Codex sentry policies (SQ-2477)
  Model Gateway now caps each Codex sentry trigger against that model's verified backend window, preserving compaction headroom for smaller-window rows. It logs one startup policy line for every model policy row, including unmeasured defaults and rows where the sentry is disabled.
- Find detached probe children by parent pid in the reap test (SQ-2478)
  The probe-child reap test now locates the supervisor's detached probe child by parent pid on Linux and macOS, where a detached child leads its own process group, so the test passes on the ubuntu CI job.

### observability 0.7.23 → 0.7.24

#### Fixes

- Give local prompt hooks room under load (SQ-2466)
  Raise the local observability lifecycle hooks, request-body preflight, and Quartermaster prompt freshness hook from 2-3 seconds to 10 seconds. Session-start hooks that spawn processes or make network calls keep their existing budgets.

### quartermaster 0.7.2 → 0.7.3

#### Fixes

- Give local prompt hooks room under load (SQ-2466)
  Raise the local observability lifecycle hooks, request-body preflight, and Quartermaster prompt freshness hook from 2-3 seconds to 10 seconds. Session-start hooks that spawn processes or make network calls keep their existing budgets.

### sidequest 5.0.28 → 5.0.29

#### Fixes

- Retain worktree recovery storage (SQ-2453)
  Sidequest now reports worktree, backup, and quarantine disk use, expires old recovery entries, and keeps only the newest entries per agent. Quarantine removes ignored build output and dependency directories after moving the checkout so recovery evidence stays readable without retaining regenerable trees.
- Recover dispatch identity for resumed live claims (SQ-2459)
  Resumed live Sidequest claims can re-mint their dispatch token and re-bind their linked isolated worktree without releasing the claim.
- Close accepted readonly oracle reviews (SQ-2462)
  Accepted oracle verdicts now close readonly reviews, preserve their completion evidence, and let their verified review identity pass integration.
- Refresh wave baselines at assembly (SQ-2463)
  Sidequest now opens each assembled wave at the current integration target, accepts ancestor-baseline candidates through the merged-tree gate, and preserves submitted candidates when assembly refuses.
- Stop the MCP exit test racing its own stdin writer (SQ-2465)
  The MCP server exit tests ignore EPIPE on the child's stdin, so a write that lands after the server's deliberate exit no longer fails the suite.
- Retry verify capture slot races (SQ-2475)
  Full-suite verification capture now waits through transient Windows slot filesystem races instead of failing while another capture releases its slot.

## v3.519.0 (2026-09-05)

### quartermaster 0.7.1 → 0.7.2

#### Fixes

- Preserve gateway startup health-check failures (SQ-2445)
- Ignore archived Sidequest boards in health audit (SQ-2449)
  Quartermaster now ignores archived Sidequest boards when reporting project and local install health.

### sidequest 5.0.27 → 5.0.28

#### Fixes

- Close abandoned MCP connections (SQ-2443)
  Sidequest now closes MCP connections that finish initialization without sending the initialized notification.

## v3.518.0 (2026-09-05)

### model-gateway 0.48.20 → 0.49.0

#### Features

- Raise Codex context windows to 920k tokens (SQ-2438)

## v3.517.0 (2026-09-04)

### sidequest 5.0.26 → 5.0.27

#### Fixes

- Serialize full-suite verification captures (SQ-2437)
  Full-suite verification captures now wait for a per-host project slot, so parallel fan-out does not exhaust the phase budget.

## v3.516.0 (2026-09-04)

### sidequest 5.0.25 → 5.0.26

#### Fixes

- Run Windows verify captures through a POSIX shell (SQ-2431)
  Verify captures on Windows now run through Git Bash when Git for Windows provides one, record which shell ran, and report a Command Prompt parse failure as `could_not_run` instead of `toolchain_missing`.
- Sign board commits when the repository requires DCO (SQ-2432)
  The board commit tool adds the `Signed-off-by` trailer when the repository asks for `git commit -s` (a `DCO`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, or `AGENTS.md` at the root naming it), so executor commits pass DCO checks without a cherry-pick.
- Dispatch isolated worktrees from local main (SQ-2433)
  Isolated dispatches now start from unpushed local integration work when it is ahead of origin, so executor worktrees and submission baselines match the branch that will receive the change.
- Check delivery reachability against the local integration branch (SQ-2434)
  `groomClose` with a `deliveryCommit` now checks reachability from the local integration branch instead of its upstream, and the completion record says whether the commit has reached the upstream yet.
- Keep landed Sidequest closes out of pending candidate conflicts (SQ-2435) [`6f06724`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6f06724fb47a68018c330157a5a9e8b432afb795)
- Live verifier amendments apply immediately (SQ-2436)
  Updating a claimed ticket's verifier now refreshes its live dispatch and records the old and new command.

## v3.515.0 (2026-09-04)

### model-gateway 0.48.19 → 0.48.20

#### Fixes

- Isolate Claude pin probes from nonessential traffic (SQ-2425)
  Claude pin probes now disable nonessential CLI traffic while preserving proxy observation for the local endpoint.

### observability 0.7.22 → 0.7.23

#### Fixes

- Make statusline health tests hermetic (SQ-2423)
  Statusline health tests now use isolated observer state, so a user's local outbox cannot change test output. The suite also covers the stalled outbox health suffix.

### sidequest 5.0.24 → 5.0.25

#### Fixes

- Keep pulse oracle state accurate (SQ-2326)
  Pulse now hides an oracle handoff after the ticket resumes work, matching verdict's pending-oracle state.
- Keep dispatched verification captures pinned (SQ-2424)
  Verification capture now keeps the command pinned in the active dispatch when an older lifecycle mirror remains in ticket state. Command mismatches show both pinned and captured commands.
- Prevent stranded worktree setup timeouts (SQ-2426)
  Worktree setup now records timeout failures, preserves the checkout, and lets recovery replace incomplete bindings.
- Reclaim settled legacy worktrees (SQ-2427)
  Reclaim clean, settled legacy agent worktrees and report factual sweep progress when SessionStart defers cleanup.
- Prevent dropped MCP wave participants (SQ-2428)
  Sidequest now refuses invalid wave arrays and highlights related submitted candidates omitted from a singleton wave.
- Reconcile candidate wave conflicts (SQ-2429)
  Allow pending candidate waves to assemble explicitly, preserve overlapping candidates, and reconcile delivered candidates despite live sibling claims.
- Flush ticket telemetry after synchronous work (SQ-2430)
  Keep a live local observer request open through synchronous CLI work, then apply its response timeout after connection.

## v3.514.0 (2026-09-04)

### model-gateway 0.48.18 → 0.48.19

#### Fixes

- Deflake model-gateway streaming and sentry tests (SQ-2414)
  Makes concurrent gateway test startup, health polling, and upstream request counting deterministic.
- Repair stale Model Gateway pin detection (SQ-2418)
  Keep Claude pin detection local and retry stale aliases without serving an old pin for a new CLI version.
- Keep Claude pin probes visible to proxy monitoring (SQ-2421)
  Keep local pin probes out of a configured proxy without hiding any non-local Claude CLI traffic from proxy monitoring.

### observability 0.7.21 → 0.7.22

#### Fixes

- Price Claude Fable 5.1 telemetry (SQ-2422)

### sidequest 5.0.23 → 5.0.24

#### Fixes

- Explain SubagentStop hook test failures (SQ-2409)
  Make the held-claim hook test show its subprocess exit details when it fails.
- Explain terminal submitted-dispatch closeout (SQ-2413)
- Recognize versionless Claude quota limits (SQ-2416)
- Keep negative-control comments with executor claims (SQ-2419)
  Negative-control evidence now stays with the claimed executor, and duplicate markers do not add duplicate comments.

## v3.513.0 (2026-09-03)

### sidequest 5.0.22 → 5.0.23

#### Fixes

- Guard live ticket closeout updates (SQ-2393)
  Sidequest now prevents executors from changing closeout-affecting fields on their claimed tickets.
- Trust dispatch identity for closeout updates (SQ-2395)
  Sidequest now accepts live closeout updates only from the runtime that prepared the dispatch, so --by and MCP labels cannot grant control-plane access.
- Guard live-claim mutations at the tool boundary (SQ-2397)
  While a ticket is live-claimed, only the orchestrator's main-thread MCP tools can change its closeout fields or delete it. Every other surface must release the claim first.

  Closeout-field updates (files, status, readonly, workingTreeDelivery, externalDeliverable, verify/verifyKind/attestationArtifact and their executor* spellings) are authorized by the PreToolUse hook via `isSubagentCaller`; the store additionally refuses them unless the MCP handler passes an explicit grant, so subagent MCP, CLI, and the dashboard all refuse a live-claim closeout change without releasing first.

  Deleting a live-claimed ticket sheds the claim and all closeout state, so it is guarded the same way: `deleteTicket` refuses a live claim unless the main-thread MCP `remove` supplies the grant. The dashboard `DELETE /api/tickets/:id` (127.0.0.1, unauthenticated, so indistinguishable from an executor's own shell on a single-user box) and CLI `rm --force` no longer override a live claim, and a subagent MCP `remove` carrying `force:true` is denied at the hook. `DELETE /api/projects/:slug`, which drops every ticket, refuses while any ticket in the project is live-claimed, and so does `sidequest merge <src> <dst>` (dry-run included), which deletes and recreates every source ticket. Arbitrary code that imports the store or starts another MCP server process remains outside that boundary.
- Bind shared dispatch claims to runtime agents (SQ-2398)
  Shared-checkout dispatches now bind their observed runtime agent when they claim, so fan-out siblings of the same executor type in one session each carry their own agent id and the write guard accepts each sibling's writes instead of refusing every shared-checkout write as an unknown identity.

  When the claim omits the optional `project`, the bind resolves the board through the same authority as the MCP claim handler (`store.sessionProjectRoot`: `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, then the process cwd), never the tool call's cwd, so a claim made from a worktree or an unrelated checkout binds the board the claim lands on. The bind also requires the runtime's session to match the reservation's: a sibling from another session presenting the owner's token is refused with `session_mismatch`.

  What the bind attaches is the harness-reported runtime (hook stdin `agent_id`) to the claim the dispatch token authorizes. The token is the per-dispatch credential and each executor is handed only its own; presenting another dispatch's token means reading a file the executor was never given, which is the same class as importing the store and sits outside this boundary. Claude Code's hook schema carries no `agent_name`, so there is no harness-authored per-dispatch discriminator beyond the token.
- Accept shared-tree sibling boundaries when submitting (SQ-2399)
  Submitting a shared-checkout candidate no longer deadlocks once a sibling's commit lands ahead of it. The submission range accepts an approved submitted-ticket boundary as its base, so a linear shared history stops reporting `duplicate_submission` for the sibling's commit while an explicit sibling base stops reporting `unrecognized_base`. Isolated single-ticket candidates keep their own merge base unchanged.

## v3.512.0 (2026-09-02)

### sidequest 5.0.21 → 5.0.22

#### Fixes

- Keep wave submissions recoverable (SQ-2384)
  Refused wave assembly keeps submitted candidates available for individual delivery and shows the recovery state in pulse.
- Guard pending groom-close delivery (SQ-2386)
  Pending submissions now need proven candidate delivery before groom-close, or an explicit recorded abandonment.
- Close unconsumed prepared dispatches during grooming (SQ-2388) [`822579c`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/822579cd6f209759cf2182ff08d516d2d4c2a753)
- Require declared external deliverable closeouts (SQ-2391)
  External deliverable closeouts now require an explicit ticket declaration and a verification capture from the current dispatch attempt.

## v3.511.0 (2026-09-01)

### sidequest 5.0.20 → 5.0.21

#### Fixes

- Honor granted write scope (SQ-2379)
  Granted scope rulings now apply to write hooks and commit admission, with consistent glob matching.
- Close working-tree deliverables (SQ-2380)
  Allow explicitly declared shared-checkout working-tree delivery with pinned verification evidence.
- Portable working-tree capture test command (SQ-2383)
  Replace the Windows-only `cd` verify command in the working-tree capture regression with a portable Node one-liner so the suite passes on Linux runners.

## v3.510.0 (2026-08-31)

### observability 0.7.20 → 0.7.21

#### Fixes

- Make retention CLI fixture time-independent (SQ-2378)
  Make the observability retention CLI test independent of the calendar date.

## v3.509.0 (2026-08-31)

### sidequest 5.0.19 → 5.0.20

#### Fixes

- Record oracle review rejections (SQ-2370)
  Rejected oracle verdicts now retire the rejected candidate after a reviewed integrated repair, while accepted reviews stay locked.
- Deliver reviewed assembled-wave interactions (SQ-2371)
  Allow assembled-wave delivery when a reviewed descendant interaction preserves the submitted paths and passes merged-tree verification.
- Validate reviewed groom-close interactions (SQ-2376)
  Validate every supplied delivery interaction through candidate containment, assembled-wave gating, and merged-tree verification before groom-close can consume a submission.

## v3.508.0 (2026-08-28)

### sidequest 5.0.18 → 5.0.19

#### Fixes

- Reconcile renamed delivered content (SQ-2369)

## v3.507.0 (2026-08-28)

### sidequest 5.0.17 → 5.0.18

#### Fixes

- Nudge native agent fan-out toward routed tickets (SQ-2367) [`7728668`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/77286684c92096783814e1c2a134681e7acb71e2)
- Name the upstream defect filing destination (SQ-2368)

## v3.506.0 (2026-08-27)

### quartermaster 0.7.0 → 0.7.1

#### Fixes

- Summarize blocked permission allowlist reports (SQ-2361)
- Keep successful hook attachments out of Quartermaster errors (SQ-2364)
  Quartermaster now separates hook timeouts from failed hooks and ignores successful context attachments.
- Improve existing Quartermaster capabilities during resupply (SQ-2366)

### sidequest 5.0.16 → 5.0.17

#### Fixes

- Keep Stop reconciliation responsive on busy boards (SQ-2363)
  Stop reconciliation now reads the active board instead of scanning tickets from every Sidequest project.
- Wait for ambient telemetry observer (SQ-2365)
  The Sidequest telemetry test now waits longer for the ambient observer's positive-control event on slow runners.

## v3.505.0 (2026-08-25)

### quartermaster 0.6.1 → 0.7.0

#### Features

- Force the Quartermaster resupply offer at a real pause (SQ-2360)

## v3.504.0 (2026-08-23)

### sidequest 5.0.15 → 5.0.16

#### Fixes

- Clarify diverged upstream integration refusals (SQ-2355)
  Explain when a submitted candidate's expected upstream no longer exists on the integration branch, including the right recovery paths.
- Retry transient installed-plugin registry reads (SQ-2357)
  Retry transient Windows registry replacement gaps during dispatch preflight so installed-plugin checks do not report a missing Sidequest install while the registry is being replaced.
- Restore verified delivery rollback (SQ-2358)
  Sidequest now restores the recorded pre-merge checkout when a post-merge verifier rebuilds tracked output, while preserving main if it advances unexpectedly.

## v3.503.0 (2026-08-23)

### model-gateway 0.48.17 → 0.48.18

  Quartermaster guidance now covers every supported scope and defaults examples to project installs.
- Describe scoped gateway wiring (SQ-2350)
  Describe Model Gateway project and machine-wide wiring scopes in updater and telemetry guidance.
- Refresh renamed plugin prose (SQ-2352)

#### Fixes

- Refresh renamed plugin prose (SQ-2352)
  Refresh stale Workbench and codex-gateway prose to the current Observability and model-gateway names, and clarify Quartermaster's managed status-line healing output.

## v3.502.0 (2026-08-22)

### sidequest 5.0.13 → 5.0.14

#### Fixes

- Explain verifier amendments during active dispatches (SQ-2343) [`831c522`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/831c5227add1d238d3f2e55817d4e32547284a69)

## v3.501.0 (2026-08-22)

### observability 0.7.18 → 0.7.19

#### Fixes

- Keep Grafana project dashboards after activity probe failures (SQ-2344)
  Dashboard provisioning keeps opted-in project matchers when the Prometheus activity probe fails or returns no projects.

## v3.500.0 (2026-08-22)

### observability 0.7.17 → 0.7.18

#### Fixes

- Clarify Docker dashboard diagnostics (SQ-2318)
  Observability now distinguishes missing Docker, daemon failures, and timed-out checks instead of incorrectly reporting Docker unavailable.
- Report stalled outbox delivery (SQ-2321)
  Report aged outbox backlogs in health and the statusline before telemetry gaps go unnoticed.
- Start observers from the newest installed plugin (SQ-2341)
  Observability hooks now launch the newest installed observer and leave a newer running observer alone.

## v3.499.0 (2026-08-22)

### sidequest 5.0.12 → 5.0.13

#### Fixes

- Reject MCP calls missing required arguments (SQ-2340)
  MCP calls with missing required arguments now explain the missing field instead of looking up an undefined ticket. Pulse also points project-wide liveness reads to changes.

## v3.498.0 (2026-08-21)

### sidequest 5.0.11 → 5.0.12

#### Fixes

- Scope board watch alerts to the active session (SQ-2338) [`b1c4664`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/b1c466442720c9ec6916fffd19f408d073e9b107)

#### Fixes

- Verify dashboard startup (SQ-2320)
  Verify the Grafana dashboard container is running and accepting OTLP before setup succeeds.

### sidequest 5.0.10 → 5.0.11

#### Fixes

- Recover stranded Sidequest redispatches (SQ-2328)
  Fresh isolated redispatches now bind to their created checkout even when the runtime reports stale identity. Token-validated failed claims can surrender immediately, and release-fragment-only checkpoints no longer block retries.
- Name refused scope paths accurately (SQ-2332)
- Make Sidequest ticket-link screenshots readable (SQ-2334)
- Stabilize settings screenshot capture (SQ-2335)
  Wait for the populated routing settings list before capturing the dashboard settings screenshot.
- Pin SessionStart sweep deadlines in tests (SQ-2336)
  Pin the SessionStart sweep deadline in hook tests so assertions do not depend on machine speed.
- Close already-landed Sidequest candidates (SQ-2337)
  Grooming now records a reachable submitted candidate as delivered without rerunning an assembled-wave gate. Missing gate commands identify the broken environment and configured worktree setup, while `skipVerify` without a complete waiver is refused before assembly.

## v3.496.0 (2026-08-21)

### model-gateway 0.48.16 → 0.48.17

#### Fixes

- Restore project-local Model Gateway wiring (SQ-2330)
  Model Gateway now writes its default wiring to each project's local settings and explains precedence when a shared user fallback is also configured.

## v3.495.0 (2026-08-21)

### observability 0.7.15 → 0.7.16

#### Fixes

- Hand off retired observers (SQ-2317)
  Observers now hand off to a verified newer installation before retiring, so an update in any project no longer stops machine-wide telemetry. Missing installations leave the active observer serving and retirement failures include the reason in the log.
- Keep observers whose record was just written (SQ-2323)
  Observability no longer treats a process record written in the current millisecond as stale, so a healthy observer is not replaced on session start.

### sidequest 5.0.9 → 5.0.10

#### Fixes

- Block foreign release-fragment scope (SQ-2316)
  Reject foreign release fragments when tickets declare files, and report every refused path in mixed scope requests.
- Widen spawn-armed deadline race window (SQ-2324)
  The deadline tree tests now leave enough startup time for Windows to record a spawned descendant before the deadline race begins.
- Distinguish wave assembly from delivery acknowledgements (SQ-2325)
  The integrate MCP response now identifies assembled waves and delivered candidates, including wave gate and invalidation context.

## v3.494.0 (2026-08-20)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.6 → 2.15.7

#### Fixes

- Make codebase-mapper Stop-veto fixture cleanup race-safe (SQ-2290)

### model-gateway 0.48.15 → 0.48.16

#### Fixes

- Tolerate partial gateway usage records (SQ-2313)
  Gateway usage polling now ignores an incomplete trailing record while it is still being appended.
- Correct stale observability paths (SQ-2314)
  Updated examples, Grafana instructions, test-support consumers, and the gateway observability seam comment to point at their current paths after the Workbench removal.

### observability 0.7.14 → 0.7.15

#### Fixes

- Restore wedged observers (SQ-2298)
  Observability now replaces a managed observer that stops refreshing its process-record heartbeat, while preserving long spool drains.
- Isolate Sidequest test telemetry (SQ-2302)
  Sidequest test CLIs no longer emit ticket telemetry to a local observer, and OTLP project resource IDs now reach observability records.
- Correct stale observability paths (SQ-2314)
  Updated examples, Grafana instructions, test-support consumers, and the gateway observability seam comment to point at their current paths after the Workbench removal.

### quartermaster 0.5.5 → 0.6.0

#### Features

- Move Workbench into Quartermaster (SQ-2307)
  Quartermaster now includes Toolshed updates, health checks, workspace settings support, and freshness hooks. The separate Workbench plugin is gone.
- Use project scope for new Toolshed installs (SQ-2308)

### sidequest 5.0.8 → 5.0.9

#### Fixes

- Isolate Sidequest test telemetry (SQ-2302)
  Sidequest test CLIs no longer emit ticket telemetry to a local observer, and OTLP project resource IDs now reach observability records.
- Reap abandoned MCP sessions (SQ-2310)
  Sidequest now closes an MCP session that stops responding while keeping its pipe open, without touching another server process.
- Refuse foreign release fragment scope requests (SQ-2311)
  Reject scope requests for another ticket’s release fragment before work starts, using the same rule the commit gate enforces.
- Prevent concurrent test fixture JSON truncation (SQ-2312)
  Write shared Sidequest install JSON through temporary files before replacing the targets atomically, so concurrent full-suite test files cannot read truncated fixture data.

## v3.493.0 (2026-08-20)

### live-rules 2.10.3 → 2.10.4

#### Fixes

- Fix stale cross-plugin command references (SQ-2306)

### model-gateway 0.48.14 → 0.48.15

#### Fixes

- Fix stale cross-plugin command references (SQ-2306)

### observability 0.7.13 → 0.7.14

#### Fixes

- Keep telemetry running when dashboard activity checks fail (SQ-2296)
  Telemetry setup now keeps the observer running and provisions the global dashboard if Prometheus cannot report active projects.
- Fix stale cross-plugin command references (SQ-2306)

### sidequest 5.0.7 → 5.0.8

#### Fixes

- Stop Sidequest MCP sibling reaping (SQ-2297)
  Sidequest MCP servers now shut down with their stdio client without killing similarly named sibling processes.

### workbench 0.88.7 → 0.89.0

#### Features

- Remove the code-intel MCP server (SQ-2305) [`b63c95c`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/b63c95c2)
  Workbench no longer ships the `code-intel` MCP server or its `definition`, `references`, and `diagnostics` tools. It covered only TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, and C++, and a language server plugin is the better route for the rest. The Toolshed doctor no longer checks for a language server backend.

## v3.492.0 (2026-08-20)

### observability 0.7.12 → 0.7.13

#### Fixes

- Finish late hook spool drains (SQ-2294)
  Finished hook spool drains now clear their temporary file and reset failure state even when the final batch exceeds its time budget.
- Keep busy observers alive (SQ-2295)
  Avoid replacing a managed observer when its health probe times out during spool processing.

### codebase-mapper 2.15.5 → 2.15.6

#### Fixes

- Correct when Live Rules guidance and the codebase map reach Claude (SQ-2289)
  State that rules land at session start and return only when their text changes, and that the codebase map also reaches dispatched executors and general-purpose subagents.

### live-rules 2.10.2 → 2.10.3

#### Fixes

- Correct when Live Rules guidance and the codebase map reach Claude (SQ-2289)
  State that rules land at session start and return only when their text changes, and that the codebase map also reaches dispatched executors and general-purpose subagents.

- Explain Remote Control project gateway opt-out (SQ-2284)
  Document turning Model Gateway off for one project and refuse RC-compatibility before a port-80 conflict can change the hosts file.

### observability 0.7.11 → 0.7.12

#### Fixes

- Correct Observability privacy and model docs (SQ-2282)
  Correct Observability privacy, recovery, and setup guidance, and list current Model Gateway IDs.
- Capture seeded Grafana observability rows (SQ-2286)
  Replace fabricated observability dashboard images with live row captures from the isolated Grafana fixture, using deterministic synthetic telemetry across the full time window.

### quartermaster 0.5.4 → 0.5.5

#### Fixes

- Align the Workbench and Quartermaster READMEs with what code-intel and live rules actually do (SQ-2291)
  Name Python and the upward language-server search in the code-intel section, and stop describing the setup-seeded live rule as per-prompt.

### sidequest 5.0.6 → 5.0.7

#### Fixes

- Align the Sidequest README with enforced submission and freshness rules (SQ-2278)
  Describe non-Git submissions as filesystem-snapshot revisions with verifier evidence, and state the dispatch version-skew rule the way the code enforces it.
- Keep route effort and ticket count readable in Settings (SQ-2285)
  Lay out each routing profile's model and effort separately from its ticket count in Settings.
- Route multi-part work through the user-story skill (SQ-2287)
  Load the user-story skill before ticketing or dispatching work beyond a small task, while keeping named quick edits, one-line fixes, operational requests, and direct questions inline.
- Detect live integration conflicts from changed paths (SQ-2288)
  Let integrations proceed past unrelated live claims by comparing submitted changed paths with each sibling ticket's declared files, while still refusing real overlap with the conflicting surfaces named.

### workbench 0.88.6 → 0.88.7

#### Fixes

- Align the Workbench and Quartermaster READMEs with what code-intel and live rules actually do (SQ-2291)
  Name Python and the upward language-server search in the code-intel section, and stop describing the setup-seeded live rule as per-prompt.

## v3.490.0 (2026-08-19)

### sidequest 5.0.5 → 5.0.6

#### Fixes

- Require completed command verification captures (SQ-2263)
  Declared command verification now requires a completed capture tied to the submitted candidate.
- Let CLI repair commits take over rejected release fragments (SQ-2268)
  CLI repair commits can replace a related review-rejected candidate's release fragment.
- Keep verification evidence outside delivered work (SQ-2269)
  Dispatches now name a board-owned verification evidence directory, keep it out of ticket scope and delivery, and name dirty integration-target paths.
- Reclaim delivered isolated worktrees promptly (SQ-2270)
  Delivered isolated worktrees now clean up at integration time, while retained continuations and busy or locked trees stay protected for the next SessionStart sweep.
- Accept documented MCP argument aliases (SQ-2271)
  MCP tools now accept the documented story and link argument names, and board settings explain their read form.
- Pin shared-file shapes before wave dispatch (SQ-2272)
  Wave planning guidance now requires shared-file shapes to be pinned in the story contract or owned by a prerequisite ticket before dispatch.

## v3.489.0 (2026-08-19)

### sidequest 5.0.4 → 5.0.5

#### Fixes

- Record reset and working-tree deliveries (SQ-2254)
  Record pinned candidate delivery when integration leaves verified content in the working tree.
- Repair chains can take over superseded release fragments (SQ-2257)
  Repair tickets can replace a rejected candidate's release fragment without shipping duplicates.
- Persist Sidequest non-Git revision adapters (SQ-2264)
- Detect prepared runtime drift (SQ-2265)
  Prepared dispatches now refuse reuse when the installed Sidequest version, MCP configuration, or hook configuration changed.
- Remove unused inline eligibility decision (SQ-2266)
  Remove the unused kernel inline-eligibility export so the orchestrator briefing remains the single authority for inline work.
- Keep manual verification contracts out of shells (SQ-2267)
  Manual verification prefixes now stay evidence contracts in legacy ticket briefings and submission checks.

## v3.488.0 (2026-08-19)

### sidequest 5.0.3 → 5.0.4

#### Fixes

- Make wave assembly the delivery authority (SQ-2261)
  Pins compatible submissions into one gated wave, delivers its exact participants together, and records verification on the resulting revision.

## v3.487.0 (2026-08-19)

### sidequest 5.0.2 → 5.0.3

#### Fixes

- Keep glob scopes consistent (SQ-2252)
  Uses one matcher for declared descendant glob scopes during requests and submission.
- Keep submission tests on generated runtime code (SQ-2253)
  Avoids a late TypeScript transform in the grooming-abandonment test so full-suite esbuild load cannot strand its test worker.

- Scope integration holds to active submission races (SQ-2244)
- Keep executor verification in the foreground (SQ-2245)
- Repair verification evidence and waivers (SQ-2247)
  Keeps evidence-only verification out of the process runner, accepts bounded waivers through CLI and MCP integrations, and preserves manual evidence in completion records.

- Clarify when to use the Sidequest skill (SQ-2249)
- Persist oracle review outcomes (SQ-2251)
  Records oracle-confirmed review defects on both sides of a bound candidate and lets an integrated repair supersede that rejected submission.

- Clean up stale atomic-write temporary files (SQ-2228)

### observability 0.7.10 → 0.7.11

#### Fixes

### quartermaster 0.5.3 → 0.5.4

#### Fixes

- Canonicalize Quartermaster project state paths (SQ-2216)
  Quartermaster now shares state and decision verification across equivalent project path spellings, and migrates existing raw-keyed state files on first read.

### sidequest 4.52.9 → 4.52.10

#### Fixes

- Require dispatched tickets for builtin executor spawns (SQ-2215)
  Modeled builtin executor spawns on routed boards now require a dispatched ticket, preventing unticketed work from bypassing the board.
- Fix cold-session Sidequest briefing guidance (SQ-2217)
  Cold SessionStart briefings no longer advertise unavailable executors, duplicate checkpoint guidance, or omit the board setup path.
- Cap GitHub Releases at one per day (SQ-2218)
  GitHub Release publishing now catches up once per UTC day without making successful release cuts wait for a deferred notification.

## v3.480.0 (2026-08-17)

### model-gateway 0.48.10 → 0.48.11

#### Fixes

- Catalog writes stop losing to whoever is reading the catalog (SQ-2212)
  The model catalog is written by replacing the file, and on Windows you cannot replace a file another process
  holds open. This one is read on every session start, so the write lost that race roughly three times a day:
  one real state directory had 32 orphaned `catalog.json.*.tmp` files spanning eleven days, every one a distinct
  catalog that was written in full and then never became the catalog. Nobody noticed because every caller
  swallows the failure, one of them commented "advisory only".

  The replace now waits out the reader and retries with a short backoff, the temp file is cleaned up whether the
  write lands or not, a failure that survives all the retries says so instead of vanishing, and a successful
  write sweeps up temps that earlier ones abandoned, so the orphans already on disk clear themselves.

### sidequest 4.52.8 → 4.52.9

#### Fixes

- Hook guidance now reaches the model, not just the terminal (SQ-2213)
  Every nudge and teaching message the hooks emitted through `systemMessage` was invisible to the model:
  Claude Code renders that field in the terminal and sends the model nothing (verified in the 2.1.233 binary,
  whose attachment table maps it to an empty message list). So the inline-work boundary nudge, the injected-model
  lessons, and the quota-fallback guidance were read by the user and never by the agent they were written for.

  Model-facing notices now mirror into `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`, which does land in the
  conversation, for PreToolUse and PostToolUseFailure. The terminal copy stays. Stop-time notices deliberately
  stay UI-only: Stop `additionalContext` resumes the conversation so the model can act on it, which would turn
  a stop-time suggestion into a loop.
- Explore fan-out no longer bypasses board routing (SQ-2214)
  Explore spawns passed the executor gate unconditionally, so a session that got its generic Agent denied could
  relaunch the same job as Explore and fan out on the session model. Observed live: four Explore deep-dives at
  165k+ tokens each doing work that a routed `codebase-exploration` spike runs on a much cheaper route, and the
  model admitting afterwards that it took the loophole.

  On a routed board, main-session Explore now has a boundary: the first two spawns pass with a model-visible
  reminder that Explore is a quick evidence sweep, the third and later are refused while the session has had no
  board interaction, and an Explore spawn matching work a generic Agent was already denied for is refused
  outright. Executors' Explore helpers, `claude-code-guide`, and `statusline-setup` are untouched, as are
  unrouted projects. The board-first reminder and the orchestration skill text now state the same boundary.

## v3.479.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.52.7 → 4.52.8

#### Fixes

- The board tells you how to call it before it refuses you (SQ-1955)
  Some board calls have a requirement the schema has no way to state: `release` needs a reason even though the schema
  only marks `ref` and `by` required, an `attestation` verify has an exact grammar, and `groomClose` is one tool doing
  three different jobs with three different gates. The grammar was written out in the source all along, but MCP strips
  property descriptions that are not on its whitelist, so it reached nobody and three tickets in a row were refused for
  guessing it.

  The contracts that a caller cannot get right on the first try now ship in the published tool schemas, which cost the
  tools/list budget a raise and are worth it. The reasons behind them, the synonyms the validator quietly accepts
  (`m` for a comment `body`, `target` for a link's `to`, `priority: "medium"` for `"normal"`), and the places the CLI
  and MCP name the same thing differently live in the skill's new `invocation-contracts` reference, drift-tested against
  the aliases and enums in code so a stale synonym list fails the build instead of misleading an agent.
- Foreign worktree diagnostics are labelled by the lease that owns them (SQ-1957)
  Claude Code keys its LSP diagnostics registry per session rather than per agent, so an executor's errors land in
  the orchestrator's context and nothing in the product can stop them: there is no setting, and no hook runs between
  publication and the attachment. That was already known. What the warning about it said was too flat to use. It
  covered only `<project>/.claude/worktrees/agent-*`, so it stayed silent for the root Sidequest actually provisions
  under, and it said nothing at all about paths already swept from disk, which is the case where every diagnostic is
  guaranteed false.

  The warning now reads the board and names each foreign worktree by the lease that owns it: a live claim (expected
  mid-refactor state that never outranks that executor's own verify), a path already gone from disk (always false),
  or a candidate awaiting integration (worth reading before you integrate, and it outweighs an executor's `verify
  passed`). Both worktree roots are covered, and a swept path keeps its line only while it can still be publishing.
- A fan-out that crossed two worktrees now sorts itself out (SQ-2190)
  Worktree creation cannot tell which dispatch a new checkout belongs to. Its hook knows the session and the path,
  and the harness agent id that names the path only reaches the board later, so under a fan-out every sibling
  reservation is eligible and creation attributes them in creation order. Create them in any other order and each
  reservation ends up holding a sibling's checkout, which both executors then discover the hard way: the binding is
  crossed, so their claims fail as `unbound_dispatch` and two runs die on a reason nobody can act on.

  The first moment anything can tell them apart is the agent reporting the checkout it is actually running in, and an
  observation outranks a guess, so the pair is exchanged instead of refused. It only ever happens between two
  reservations of the same session that are both still unclaimed and identity-unbound, so a checkout is never taken
  from an executor that has proven it owns one, and a path no reservation in the session created still matches
  nothing and is still refused.

### workbench 0.88.3 → 0.88.4

#### Fixes

- Health findings stop calling an installed plugin missing (SQ-2211)
  A project can enable a plugin two ways: install it, or list it under `enabledPlugins` in its own
  `.claude/settings.json`. The second way leaves no row in Claude Code's install registry, and the health check
  only read the registry, so it announced "this project has a codebase map but no codebase-mapper install, so
  nothing maintains it" at a project whose committed settings enable exactly that plugin. Same for a Sidequest
  board enabled the same way. Both findings are classed as blocking the user, which is the worst place to be
  wrong.

  Marketplaces have the same split: a project can declare its own under `extraKnownMarketplaces` with
  `autoUpdate: true`, and that flag never lands in the user registry either, so two marketplaces that update
  themselves fine were reported as having auto-update off.

  Both questions now read the project's settings alongside the registry, honoring an explicit `false` in a
  higher-precedence file as the disable it is, while a layer that merely names something without a flag changes
  nothing. A user-level enable still reads as enabled everywhere rather than installed here. The registry keeps
  doing what it is actually good for, which is saying which version a project runs and where its cache lives.

  Net effect on the project that turned this up: three findings, all of them announced as blocking, down to the
  one that was true.

## v3.478.0 (2026-08-17)

### model-gateway 0.48.9 → 0.48.10

#### Fixes

- The gateway tells you when it needs you, instead of telling only the model (SQ-1901)
  The gateway's session-start hook has always noticed a half-configured state: not set up, not signed in, running
  but not wired to this session, a proxy it could not start. It said so on stdout, which is model context and
  nothing else, so the one person who could fix it never saw a word. A session sat unwired for hours and it took
  asking the model which hooks had run to find out.

  Now those states get one line in the session's system message, where you can actually see it, and each names its
  own exact command. Routine output stays out of it, so a healthy session says nothing to you. The hook always
  exits 0 for this reason: Claude Code reads a hook's message only from a clean exit, so failing loudly there
  would trade the line you can read for a bare "hook failed" badge. Running `ensure` yourself still exits nonzero.

  One new state is called out: wiring that exists only as an exported `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with no settings file
  behind it. That routes the terminal you exported it in and nothing else, and `setup` deliberately will not copy
  an environment value into your settings, so it skipped the write on every run and said nothing useful about it.
  Both messages now name `env --write-user`.

### sidequest 4.52.6 → 4.52.7

#### Fixes

- A candidate review can only close from the tree it was asked to review (SQ-2207)
  A review-audit ticket bound to an exact candidate is dispatched into an isolated checkout at that commit, and
  its briefing tells it to detach onto it. Nothing checked that it was still standing there when it closed, so a
  reviewer that walked off the candidate could record a verdict about different code. That is how a commit whose
  own suite passed got rejected.

  A review now ENDS on its candidate. At a terminal `done` the board reads the review checkout's own revision:
  another commit is refused as `review_tree_mismatch`, which names the observed revision, the candidate, and the
  exact `git -C <worktree> checkout --detach <candidate>` repair, and a checkout it cannot read at all is refused
  as `review_tree_unobservable` and released as a technical blocker instead of closing unobserved. The reviewer
  is told the rule in its briefing, including that comparing against the integration branch never needs HEAD to
  move. A review that finds a defect is unaffected: it still releases with kind oracle.

### workbench 0.88.2 → 0.88.3

#### Fixes

- Project health findings you have to fix now reach you, not only the model (SQ-1900)
  The session-start health check emits its report as SessionStart additional context, which only the model reads.
  So a finding you personally had to go fix reached nobody. On 2026-08-13 it correctly found a Sidequest board
  whose install had been pruned away, auto-update off, and a stale marketplace cache, and none of that surfaced
  until someone thought to ask the model what hooks had fired.

  Findings that need YOUR action now get one line in the session's system message: the worst one, a count of the
  rest, and a nudge to ask for the full health report. A session with nothing wrong still says nothing at all,
  because this fires on every session start and noise is how a warning stops being read. Which findings those are
  is recorded where each one is produced, not guessed from its wording: a missing install, an unregistered
  marketplace, a gateway that is down or unauthenticated, and a Node or Claude Code below the floor block you;
  auto-update off and a stale cache are drifting on you. An install merely behind its cached version stays quiet
  here, because the update notice already names it with its remedy.
- A codebase map with nothing maintaining it now says so (SQ-2209)
  The session-start health check already tells you when a Sidequest board has lost its Sidequest install. A
  codebase map had no equivalent: a project carrying `.claude/.codebase-info` with codebase-mapper uninstalled kept
  injecting that map on every session start, which reads as maintained while it quietly goes out of date.

  That state is now a finding, with the same distinction the board check makes: a user-scope install is called out
  as having no project or local install rather than none at all. A project with no map is never asked to install a
  mapper.

## v3.477.0 (2026-08-17)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.4 → 2.15.5

#### Fixes

- Test fixtures pin their initial git branch, and a guard keeps them pinned (SQ-2201)
  `git init` takes its branch name from `init.defaultBranch`, and the full suite runs with global and system git
  config nulled out, so the same fixture started on `main` under `npm run test:files` and `master` under
  `npm run test:full`. A fixture that later named a branch did not fail cleanly there: `git checkout main` with
  no local `main` and an `origin/main` present creates a local branch tracking the remote, so the assertions ran
  against a tree the fixture never built. That cost two full-gate failures whose entire output was two
  unexplained shas.

  Every git fixture across both suites now passes `-b main` to `git init` (43 call sites), and a new guard test
  scans the sidequest test directory for a `git init` that inherits the ambient default. A test that is
  deliberately about the unconfigured default opts out with an `unpinned-initial-branch: <why>` comment, which
  is how the one honest case, the assertion that the full suite has no default branch configured, stays.

### model-gateway 0.48.8 → 0.48.9

#### Fixes

- Codex and Grok models stop vanishing five minutes after the gateway's last catalog write (SQ-2208)
  Sidequest treats a model-gateway catalog older than five minutes as absent, which is right: a catalog nobody
  has rewritten proves nothing about a gateway that may be down. Nothing rewrites it on its own, though, so on a
  healthy machine every Codex and Grok model silently disappeared from every board five minutes after whatever
  command last happened to touch the file, and stayed gone until some unrelated command touched it again. A board
  routing a category to a gateway model then refused to dispatch it as "not available from the live catalog".

  Readiness already refreshed a stale catalog through the newest installed gateway; the model list now shares that
  path, so a stale catalog costs one refresh per process instead of going dark. A failed refresh is retried after
  thirty seconds rather than pinned for the whole five-minute window, and a gateway that is down cannot spawn a
  child process per route resolution.

  That refresh had never actually worked. It parsed the gateway CLI's stdout, and `catalog --refresh --json` prints
  a human diagnostic line when the write preserves models from a subset response, so the parse threw and the
  refresh returned nothing in the exact case it exists for. Two fixes, one per side: the refresh now runs for its
  side effect and re-reads the catalog file, which is the authority, and the gateway keeps a `--json` invocation's
  stdout to data by emitting human lines on stderr. Its exit code is not the authority either, since it exits 0
  printing the stored catalog when the proxy is down, so an attempt counts as a refresh only when the file it left
  behind is current.

### sidequest 4.52.5 → 4.52.6

#### Fixes

- A missing remote integration ref refuses instead of silently rebasing the dispatch (SQ-2089)
  With `worktreeBase: origin-main`, a configured `integrationBranch` whose remote ref did not exist silently
  produced no integration target, so the isolated checkout was based on whatever main happened to be rather
  than on the branch the board named as its authority. That is how a recovery wave generated an immutable
  candidate parented on a stale commit nobody had configured.

  One catch covered two different situations. A repository with no `origin` at all has no remote baseline to
  want, so falling through to the non-integration default is right there and stays. A repository that HAS an
  origin but is missing that branch's remote ref is a configured authority that did not resolve, and it now
  refuses with the missing ref named and both ways out: fetch or push the branch, or set `worktreeBase` to
  `local-main` to fork the local branch instead. A refused baseline mints no dispatch token.

  Measured across a fixture with three distinct commits (stale `origin/main`, an advanced local `main`, and a
  separate configured branch), the other three combinations were already correct and still are: `origin-main`
  forks the remote ref even when local main is ahead, `local-main` forks the local branch, and a configured
  non-main branch is the authority rather than main. `dispatch.baseCommit` and the created worktree HEAD agree
  in every case that launches, and pushing the previously-unpushed branch makes the identical configuration
  legal.
- Test fixtures pin their initial git branch, and a guard keeps them pinned (SQ-2201)
  `git init` takes its branch name from `init.defaultBranch`, and the full suite runs with global and system git
  config nulled out, so the same fixture started on `main` under `npm run test:files` and `master` under
  `npm run test:full`. A fixture that later named a branch did not fail cleanly there: `git checkout main` with
  no local `main` and an `origin/main` present creates a local branch tracking the remote, so the assertions ran
  against a tree the fixture never built. That cost two full-gate failures whose entire output was two
  unexplained shas.

  Every git fixture across both suites now passes `-b main` to `git init` (43 call sites), and a new guard test
  scans the sidequest test directory for a `git init` that inherits the ambient default. A test that is
  deliberately about the unconfigured default opts out with an `unpinned-initial-branch: <why>` comment, which
  is how the one honest case, the assertion that the full suite has no default branch configured, stays.
- A candidate review is told to synchronize its worktree to the exact candidate (SQ-2203)
  A `review-audit` dispatch bound to a candidate recorded that commit as its baseline, and then nothing told the
  reviewer to go there. The only emitter of the "Worktree synchronization (run before work)" instruction
  required `dispatch.integrationTarget`, and a readonly dispatch never has one, because `readonly` alone makes
  `isolatedRepositoryDispatch` false where that target is chosen. So the reviewer kept whatever commit the
  harness gave its worktree, ran that tree's suite, and could reject a candidate whose own declared suite
  passed.

  The briefing now emits a candidate synchronization instruction whenever a dispatch carries a Git review
  candidate, whether or not an integration target exists: check `git rev-parse HEAD`, detach onto the candidate
  if it differs, and stop and report if that fails rather than reviewing what the worktree holds. No fetch is
  involved, because a linked worktree shares the project repository's object database and preparation has
  already resolved the commit there.

  The orchestration reference said dispatch "pins the review to that exact immutable commit in an isolated
  checkout", which was true of the board record and not of the checkout. It now says how the checkout gets
  there.
- Dispatching a ticket whose submission is pending refuses instead of minting an unclaimable attempt (SQ-2204)
  A ticket with a pending submission is parked for the publish transaction, and claiming one has always been
  refused with reason `submitted` because re-claiming would fork an already-verified commit. Preparing a
  dispatch over it was not refused, so it minted a token no executor could ever claim, and the fresh prepared
  attempt then outranked the submitted one in the dispatch projection while the submission stayed valid.
  Anything reading the current `dispatch.agentId` for provenance read an executor that never touched the
  candidate.

  Preparation now refuses while a submission is pending, before anything is written, and names the three exits:
  integrate it, `rework` it (which clears the submission, so it is the path to a replacement executor), or close
  it as an abandoned submission with evidence it never landed. A refused preparation mints no token and leaves
  the submitted attempt on top, so an attempt already recorded on a board this way stays in history rather than
  being retroactively dropped.
- An unprepared Codex claim names the executor the ticket actually answers to (SQ-2205)
  A readonly Codex ticket with no prepared dispatch refused a claim from the only executor it is ever spawned
  as, `sidequest-exec-dispatch-readonly`, and the refusal told it to spawn `sidequest-exec-dispatch` instead.
  The guard compared the caller's name against `exec.agent`, which is the read-write dispatch name for every
  Codex route whether the category is readonly or not. That is the exact refusal pair reported in SQ-2110, and
  it reproduces on a single version with no plugin skew.

  Claim refusals now name the executor prepare would record, which is the same authority the prepared-dispatch
  comparison already used, so the three refusals that name an executor before a dispatch exists
  (`executor_mismatch`, `effort_mismatch`, `direct_not_allowed`) all agree with it.

  Two agent-facing reference surfaces were stale in the same place. `routing-details.md` still showed the
  pre-collapse `sidequest-exec-dispatch-<effort>` shape and told the orchestrator to spawn `exec.agent`, which
  is the wrong executor for a readonly category; it now points at the executor the dispatch returned.
  `orchestration.md` claimed all five effort levels are provisioned for Codex dispatch, where in fact Codex
  dispatch is one read-write def and one readonly def, with effort carried by the route marker.
- A bound dispatch that never claimed can be retired on evidence instead of stranding its ticket (SQ-2206)
  A dispatch that bound a runtime and never claimed had exactly one exit: its own stop hook. Redispatch refused
  it as a live attempt, recovery evidence refused it as bound to a runtime, and session-start reconciliation
  skips bound attempts deliberately. So a runtime that died without firing that hook, a killed process, a closed
  session, a harness crash, left the ticket unreachable by every board path. The recorded recovery for that
  state was resuming the original session just to let it exit.

  A claim is a bound executor's FIRST action, so a bound attempt that has not claimed within the board's
  claim-idle backstop is not winding down, it is gone. Recovery evidence now retires that attempt, and only
  after the backstop: inside the window a live executor stays protected exactly as before, and the refusal says
  how many minutes are left and that the terminal hook is the normal exit. The retired attempt is recorded with
  failure shape `stranded_bound_launch_superseded`, distinct from the unbound `unclaimed_launch_superseded`.

  `pulse` now reports that state as `stalled` with "dispatch bound a runtime that never claimed, past the
  claim-idle backstop", because an orchestrator cannot reach for a recovery it is never told about. The CLI help,
  the MCP `recoveryEvidence` description, the claim-token refusal guidance, and the orchestration reference all
  name the second shape now.
- Codex and Grok models stop vanishing five minutes after the gateway's last catalog write (SQ-2208)
  Sidequest treats a model-gateway catalog older than five minutes as absent, which is right: a catalog nobody
  has rewritten proves nothing about a gateway that may be down. Nothing rewrites it on its own, though, so on a
  healthy machine every Codex and Grok model silently disappeared from every board five minutes after whatever
  command last happened to touch the file, and stayed gone until some unrelated command touched it again. A board
  routing a category to a gateway model then refused to dispatch it as "not available from the live catalog".

  Readiness already refreshed a stale catalog through the newest installed gateway; the model list now shares that
  path, so a stale catalog costs one refresh per process instead of going dark. A failed refresh is retried after
  thirty seconds rather than pinned for the whole five-minute window, and a gateway that is down cannot spawn a
  child process per route resolution.

  That refresh had never actually worked. It parsed the gateway CLI's stdout, and `catalog --refresh --json` prints
  a human diagnostic line when the write preserves models from a subset response, so the parse threw and the
  refresh returned nothing in the exact case it exists for. Two fixes, one per side: the refresh now runs for its
  side effect and re-reads the catalog file, which is the authority, and the gateway keeps a `--json` invocation's
  stdout to data by emitting human lines on stderr. Its exit code is not the authority either, since it exits 0
  printing the stored catalog when the proxy is down, so an attempt counts as a refresh only when the file it left
  behind is current.

## v3.476.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.52.4 → 4.52.5

#### Fixes

- Verify-path warnings resolve arguments against the base the command establishes (SQ-1962)
  Dispatch validation told four tickets in a row that their existing test files were absent from the repo, and
  reported a git revision range as a missing file. It resolved every path-shaped token in the recorded verify
  command against the repository root, no matter what base the command set up.

  Measured before the fix, four of seven representative commands were wrong:

      npm --prefix plugins/sidequest run test:files -- test/mcp.test.ts   absent: test/mcp.test.ts
      cd plugins/sidequest && npm run test:files -- test/*.test.ts        absent: test/...
      git diff 1af30b7f..fa999563 --name-only                            absent: 1af30b7f..fa999563

  Arguments now resolve against the base their own command segment establishes, through `npm --prefix` or a
  `cd`, and the prefix operand is consumed rather than resolved a second time against the directory it just
  named. A `cd` moves the base for every segment after it wherever it appears, not only as the first one: real
  recorded commands walk between packages partway through with `cd ../workbench` and `cd ../..`. Git segments are skipped: revisions and paths share the same operand position there, and
  `base..candidate` is a range rather than a climb out of a directory, so nothing in one can be resolved
  without guessing. A base that is missing or outside the repo is left to the check that names the directory,
  instead of being reported again as absent files.

  A genuinely missing path still warns, and now names where the command would actually look for it
  (`plugins/sidequest/test/missing.test.ts` rather than a bare `test/missing.test.ts` that could mean either
  place).
- Anchor prose stops becoming symbol probes (SQ-1987)
  Whatever word sat before `in <path>` in an anchor became a source-symbol assertion, so ordinary sentences
  demanded ordinary English as code: `lives`, `both`, and `each` were each reported missing from a real file,
  and the author's only workaround was contorting the sentence until the parser stopped recognizing a claim.

  A symbol claim now needs explicit evidence: backticks the author typed, or a token shaped like code (an
  underscore, a `$`, or a camelCase hump). Measured over the 46 recorded anchor claims across these boards, 35
  were ordinary English and every genuine symbol among the rest still qualifies, including a commit sha and a
  sentence-initial capitalized word that both correctly stop warning. Missing-path warnings are untouched, and
  ticket-authoring guidance now says how to opt an all-lowercase identifier back into the check.
- Story decision freshness warnings are pinned across every temporal order (SQ-2079)
  A dogfood report said a story decision log warning named a decision that predated its ticket, on a ticket
  that was still todo with no claim. Four writers set the boundary that warning compares against (ticket
  creation, story attach, dispatch preparation, claim), so which one ran decides whether a decision counts as
  unseen, and a report like that means one of them did not run.

  Measured across eight temporal orders, the current build gets all of them right: a decision that predates the
  ticket is recorded as seen at creation, an unclaimed todo ticket is never told something is missing from a
  briefing it does not have yet, claiming and preparing both move the boundary to the moment they froze the
  briefing, and attaching a claimed ticket to a story inherits the decisions that story already had. Only a
  decision that lands after a claim or after a dispatch preparation warns, and it names which of the two it
  outran.

  Those eight orders are now a regression matrix in the suite. No behavior changed.
- Retire a prepared dispatch that never reached a runtime (SQ-2136)
  Recovery evidence only retired a dispatch whose outcome was `launched`, so a `prepared` attempt that never
  launched refused with a message asserting it was bound, claimed, checkpointed, or terminal when it was none
  of those. An orchestrator reading that refusal had no reason to believe the ticket was recoverable at all.

  `dispatch --recovery-evidence` (MCP `recoveryEvidence`) now retires either pre-runtime state, prepared or
  launched, as long as nothing downstream of the token exists: no runtime binding, no claim, no checkpoint. The
  retired attempt is preserved in `dispatch.attempts` with its evidence and its unlaunched timestamps, and one
  fresh dispatch identity is prepared. Bound, claimed, checkpointed, and terminal attempts still fail closed,
  and the refusal now names which of those it actually found instead of listing all four.

  The CLI help for `dispatch` also documents `--recovery-evidence`, which it accepted but never mentioned.
- A fixture gateway catalog no longer expires partway through a long test file (SQ-2199)
  The product treats a model-gateway catalog older than five minutes as absent, which is right on a real machine:
  a gateway that stopped answering should refuse dispatch and tell you to run `ensure`, not silently reroute.
  Twelve test files write one fake catalog at module load, so on a slow runner they cross that line mid-file and
  every codex route they set up starts refusing. That is what turned the v3.475.0 release commit red on
  windows-latest, in two scope tests that never mention a provider:

      not ok 746 - shared-tree live dispatches grow their scope without shedding the submission binding
      not ok 747 - MCP update lets the claim holder narrow isolated live dispatch scope but refuses combined
                   additions

  Both threw `Codex dispatch refused: model-gateway readiness is unavailable`, and a re-run of the same commit
  was green, so the failing input was elapsed time rather than anything in the diff. Measured on win32: a catalog
  stamped four minutes ago answers with readiness ready and one discovered model, one stamped six minutes ago
  answers with null and no models.

  A shared `beforeEach` now re-stamps whatever catalog `SIDEQUEST_DISCOVERY_DIRS` points at, so what a test
  proves depends on the catalog it seeded rather than on how long the suite has been running. The file that
  asserts the stale behavior itself keeps its own catalogs and does not use the hook.
- Verify preflight looks up each npm script in the package its own segment reached (SQ-2200)
  The preflight that refuses an unrunnable verify command stripped only a leading `cd` and then treated that
  one directory as the base for every following segment. So `cd first && npm run build && cd ../second && npm
  run build:check` had `build:check` looked up in `first/package.json`, and a command that walks between
  packages could be refused at filing time for a script that is exactly where it belongs.

  This is the same defect SQ-1962 fixed one function over in the path scanner, and it matters more here because
  this check throws rather than warns: a false positive blocks filing the ticket. The base now moves on any
  `cd` segment wherever it appears, and a `cd` that leaves the repository is still refused by the message that
  says so. Single-`cd` commands, which are nearly all of them, behave exactly as before.

## v3.475.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.52.3 → 4.52.4

#### Fixes

- A race row that loses its own startup race no longer fails the gate (SQ-2197)
  The exact-deadline race test gives each row a 500ms deadline, and the phase root has to start a node
  interpreter, spawn a second node and record its descendant's pid inside that window. On a loaded
  windows-latest runner the deadline sometimes wins, and nothing about termination is broken when it does.

  Before SQ-2195 this appeared as a zero-byte pid file parsed as pid 0, reported as a descendant still live
  after 5000ms, blaming termination for a pid that was never written. With the pid file now written by rename it
  surfaced honestly as "the phase root never reported its descendant", which is accurate but still failed the
  gate on unchanged code.

  The row cannot simply be skipped: the root spawns its descendant before recording the pid, so a missing pid
  does not prove that no descendant exists. A row without a pid now skips only the by-pid terminality probe and
  still contributes to the marker check every row gets, which asserts the descendant never acted, the property
  the test exists to prove. At least 60 of the 100 roots must record a descendant, so the test reports a runner
  too loaded to be testing termination instead of quietly passing on marker checks alone.

## v3.474.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.52.2 → 4.52.3

#### Fixes

- A raw commit in an isolated worktree no longer costs the write lease (SQ-2193)
  SQ-2182 fixed the commit path the board owns. A raw `git commit` reached the identical dead end by a route no
  guard covered: `guard-shared-tree-commit` skips any checkout whose `.git` is a file, which is every linked
  worktree, so the commit succeeded, recorded nothing, and every later Edit or Write in that worktree was
  refused for the rest of the run. Submit then demanded a release fragment the executor could no longer write.

  Denying the raw commit instead was the original plan and it turned out to be wrong. SQ-2180's preserve step
  tells a dirty continuation to run `git add -A && git commit` in exactly that worktree, and that step cannot
  go through the board tool, which commits declared scope only while preserving needs everything in the tree.

  So the write lease is what changed. It demanded the observed revision EQUAL the dispatch baseline; it now
  accepts any revision the baseline is an ancestor of, while the authorizing claim is still held. That is not a
  relaxation so much as making the lease agree with the contract executors already receive: the worktree
  synchronization step in every dispatch briefing defines a correct worktree as one where
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <baseCommit> HEAD` passes. The two rules disagreed and the briefing's was right.

  Creation deliberately keeps exact equality. Submission ranges are computed against the baseline, so a
  worktree created even one commit ahead of it would attribute a commit this executor never wrote to the ticket.

  The refusals that remain now name their own cause instead of one shared message: foreign history says HEAD
  does not descend from the baseline, a released claim says the claim is gone, and an unreadable ancestry says
  that rather than implying drift. Ancestry is tracked as three states, not a boolean, so "could not read it"
  keeps refusing instead of collapsing into the same value as "is not an ancestor".

  `scripts/_exec-template.md` said `mcp__plugin_sidequest_board__commit` was the only sanctioned commit path,
  unscoped, which contradicted the preserve step it also ships. It is now scoped to the shared tree, and states
  the isolated-worktree tradeoff plainly: the board tool commits declared scope only, a raw commit takes
  everything including paths you never requested.
- Test bounds stop measuring how loaded the runner is (SQ-2194)
  Three separate gate failures on unchanged code came from the same mistake: an assertion with a tuned
  millisecond ceiling. SQ-2179, SQ-2191 and a 100ms flush window in the verify-capture test all failed because
  a loaded runner missed a bound, not because anything regressed.

  The remaining sites in the owned-process-tree test are converted to one named budget that separates
  "termination finished" from "termination hung". A hung path takes the whole phase timeout or never ends, so
  anything comfortably short of that timeout draws the same line, and a tighter number tests nothing extra.
  Two of the old call sites reported bounds of 900ms and 700ms in their failure messages while actually
  asserting 1600ms and 1200ms, which the shared helper makes impossible.

  One bound stays deliberately tight, and says why: 1884 of that test's 1885 sequences end with a supervisor
  that never settles, so the grace is spent on nearly every row and widening it would push the test past its
  own timeout. Its only assertion is on the green/not-green verdict, which does not depend on how long
  termination took.
- A value that is not a process id is refused instead of reading as live (SQ-2195)
  The Test workflow went red on `main` for v3.473.0, on windows-latest only, with one failure out of 1193:

      the descendant of race row 81 (process 0) was still live after 5000ms

  Process 0 is not a process id. `kill` reads 0 as a process group, so on win32 `process.kill(0, 0)` simply
  succeeds and `classifyProcessState(0)` answers `live` forever. The row waited out its entire budget and then
  reported a leaked descendant that had never existed, which is a worse failure than the flake: the message
  named termination as the cause when the real cause was a pid that was never recorded.

  It came from an unparsed pid file. The phase-root fixture wrote its descendant's pid with
  `fs.writeFileSync`, which creates the file before it fills it, and the race deadline kills that root at an
  arbitrary instant. A kill landing inside that window leaves a zero-byte file, and `Number('')` is 0.

  Three changes. `classifyProcessState` now throws on anything that is not a positive integer rather than
  answering a question the caller did not ask. The fixture writes its pid file by rename, which is atomic, so
  a reader sees either no file or the whole pid. And the pid readers validate what they parsed, so a fixture
  that failed to record a pid says exactly that instead of handing a bogus value to a termination assertion.
- Seed refresh no longer tries to nest a transaction (SQ-2196)
  An unrelated operation could fail with `cannot start a transaction within a transaction`. It took down a
  submission test on windows-latest, and the trigger was neither submissions nor that test: it was a routing
  profile left mismatched by something that ran earlier in the same process.

  `transaction()` has always been reentrancy-guarded, because SQLite has no nested transactions. The two
  routing-profile seed refreshers called `db.txn` directly and so could not see an open transaction. Both run
  from `database()`, which any code inside an open transaction is free to call, so a seed that needed repairing
  at that moment began a second transaction and threw out of whichever operation happened to be running.

  All three now share one depth-guarded helper, so a seed refresh reached from inside a transaction joins it
  instead of beginning its own. A test asserts that the helper is the only thing that begins a transaction,
  which is the part a future change could get wrong again.

- A continuation with retained uncommitted work is no longer told to discard it (SQ-2180)
  When an executor picked up a ticket whose previous attempt had left uncommitted work in its worktree, and
  a release had landed in between, the sync step told it to `git reset --hard` onto the new base. That would
  have destroyed the retained work, which existed nowhere else: not committed, not stashed, not pinned. One
  executor read the instruction, said it would destroy 11 files, and stopped to ask instead of following it.

  That state now gets a preserve-first sequence: commit the retained changes on the worktree's own branch,
  check that the commit really covers them, then rebase onto the new base. It also says why not to reach for
  `git stash` (the stash stack is shared with other worktrees and sessions, so a pop can take someone else's
  entry) and why to rebase rather than merge (a release deletes the changelog fragments it consumed, and
  merging an older base forward brings them back and re-ships released entries).

  The sync step for a clean worktree is unchanged.
- Continuations can reach their retained worktree again (SQ-2183)
  A ticket that ended with a retained worktree could not be redispatched. The continuation briefing opened by
  telling the executor to call `EnterWorktree` on that worktree, and `EnterWorktree` only accepts worktrees
  under `<repo>/.claude/worktrees` while board-retained ones live under the Sidequest home. Nothing
  reconciles those two locations, so the call failed every time, and executors released without doing any
  work because the first step of their contract was impossible.

  Moving the working directory was never necessary. The claim already binds the ticket to the retained
  worktree, so writes there are authorized, and the shared-checkout guard only refuses git mutations aimed at
  the shared root. The briefing now says to work the retained worktree by absolute path and run git against
  it with `git -C`, and it says plainly not to call `EnterWorktree`.

  The dirty-resume contract also now states that the retained changes were never committed and never stashed,
  so that worktree holds the only copy.

## v3.472.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.52.0 → 4.52.1

#### Fixes

- Committing through the board no longer costs an executor its write access (SQ-2182)
  An executor that committed its work through the board lost the ability to write anything else in its own
  worktree. The commit moved HEAD away from the revision the dispatch recorded, the write guard read that as
  drift, and every following edit was refused. Submit then asked for a release fragment the executor was no
  longer allowed to create, so the run ended with finished work it could not hand in.

  The board now records the commits it authors for a held claim, and the write guard treats those as the
  executor's own sanctioned work instead of drift. Losing the claim still takes the write authority away.

  The refusal you get for a genuinely unexpected revision now leads with the reason and says plainly that
  scope is not the problem, because the old wording sent executors off to request access they already had.

## v3.471.0 (2026-08-17)

### sidequest 4.51.0 → 4.52.0

#### Features

- Concurrent dispatches from one session no longer collapse into no dispatch at all (SQ-2189)
  Two write executors launched from the same orchestrator session were both refused their FIRST edit, inside their own isolated worktree, and told they had no dispatch record for a shared-checkout write. Both correctly followed the recovery text and ended themselves, so write dispatch was unusable on that board for the rest of the session.

  The cause is that a dispatch record carries the session id and the executor name, and a fan-out gives every sibling the same pair. `dispatchIsolationExpectation` resolved a set of two candidates to no match at all, exactly as if the board had never heard of the executor. A dispatch that ran alone in the same session bound its runtime identity and wrote fine, which is why this only showed up under concurrency.

  The observed checkout now breaks the tie. Callers pass the worktree they are acting in, and a candidate set is narrowed to the dispatch that reserved that path, which can only ever pick from candidates that already matched on session and executor. The same evidence now also disambiguates runtime identity binding, where it had been used only when no agent name was supplied at all: a completed creation target is a reserved path unique to one dispatch, so it outranks a name, and gating it on a missing name left a named bind ambiguous whenever a sibling had no recorded name to filter against.

  Two things about the refusal itself:

  - A write confined to the agent's own linked worktree is no longer called a shared-checkout write. That classification pointed every reader at the wrong fault while the real one, an unresolvable dispatch identity, went unnamed.
  - The refusal now carries what the board actually saw: how many live dispatch records matched the session, the session and executor together, the agent id, and the observed worktree. Every cause of an unresolved identity used to produce the same sentence, and the hook payload that separates them is gone by the time anyone investigates.

#### Fixes

- Exact-deadline race rows no longer measure runner load (SQ-2191)
  The 100-row exact-deadline race test failed on windows-latest against unchanged production code: one row reported its phase root still alive 260ms after termination started, which is the sum of a 60ms termination grace and a 200ms cleanup drain. On a contended runner that window is not long enough to reap a spinning phase root every time.

  Both values are timeouts rather than sleeps, so a wider window costs nothing when the tree dies promptly and only changes what counts as a broken termination path. Raised to 400ms and 600ms. The combined window stays well under the descendant fixture's own 2000ms lifetime, which is what keeps the assertion honest: a descendant that self-exits instead of being terminated is still caught.

  Same class as the pid-recycling failure in the same test: a tuned millisecond bound measuring the runner instead of the behavior under test.

## v3.470.0 (2026-08-16)

### sidequest 4.50.8 → 4.51.0

#### Features

- Grooming can close a submission that never landed (SQ-2188)
  A ticket holding a submitted candidate that never reached the integration branch could not be closed at all. Grooming tried to record the candidate as delivered, which is refused because the commit is not reachable from the branch, and integration is refused because the candidate no longer merges. That left 46 tickets on one board with no legal closure, which is how a board fills up with work nobody can retire.

  `groom-close` now takes `--abandon-submission` (MCP `abandonSubmission`), which records the candidate as abandoned instead of dressing it up as a delivery. The reachability test is the mirror of the delivery path's: abandonment is legal only while the candidate is absent from the integration branch, so it can never be used to write off work that actually shipped. Attempting it on a candidate that did land is refused as `candidate_already_landed` and points at the delivery closure instead.

  The refusal an agent gets when a delivery closure fails now names the abandonment path and the evidence it needs, rather than leaving grooming with no move it knows about. That hint keys on whether the candidate is actually reachable from the integration branch, not on the refusal code: a stranded candidate is refused for divergence long before reachability is ever checked, and a candidate that did land can be refused for reasons abandonment would not fix, such as a pending candidate review. Keying it on the code sent one such ticket a message telling it to abandon work that had already shipped.

#### Fixes

- Stop the owned-process-tree gate failing on healthy code (SQ-2179)
  Two tests in the owned-process-tree suite failed on windows-latest against code they do not exercise, four times in one day across three commits, and passed on rerun of unchanged shas. Both were measuring the runner instead of the product.

  The exact-deadline race test collected all 100 descendant process ids and only probed them once the loop finished, about 50 seconds later. Windows recycles process ids aggressively, so an exited descendant's id could land on an unrelated live process by the time it was probed, which read as a leaked descendant. Each row now proves its own descendant terminal immediately, while that id still names only that descendant.

  The Windows live-handle test asserted termination finished in under 20ms as a stand-in for "no helper process was spawned". That timed the CI runner's load. The mechanism is stated directly in the result instead: only the directly-owned path reports no owned group id and makes the phase process its own owner. The latency bound stays, widened to the grace window the phase was actually given, where it still catches an escalation or a spawned terminator without failing on a busy machine.
- Grooming can close tickets whose work already shipped (SQ-2184)
  Closing a ticket whose work was already released used to be impossible. Every control-plane path refused it: plain grooming said `pending_submission`, passing a delivery commit said `missing_release_fragment`, and both `--integration` and `integrate` said `tip_mismatch` with a bare `.` as the offending path.

  Two things were wrong. The delivery-closure fragment check asked whether the release fragment still existed on disk, but the release cut deletes fragments when it consumes them, so the check was permanently false for anything already shipped. And a submission whose commit had already reached the integration branch produced an empty range, which the scope validator reported as the repo root being out of scope.

  The fragment check is now split: the pre-submit gate still requires the fragment on disk, while a delivery closure only requires it in the delivery commit that added it. A submission already reachable from the integration branch is recognised as reconciled instead of refused. Grooming a ticket that still holds a pending submission now records that submission as delivered, provided the commit is reachable from the integration branch and preserves the submitted content.

## v3.469.0 (2026-08-16)

### model-gateway 0.48.7 → 0.48.8

#### Fixes

- Stabilize exact-deadline descendant evidence (SQ-2168)

## v3.467.0 (2026-08-16)

### sidequest 4.50.5 → 4.50.6

#### Fixes

- Bind read-only review identity after target completion (SQ-2159)
  A read-only executor whose subagent start raced its own worktree creation used to run to completion with no hook-bound runtime identity, so a finished independent review could not satisfy the candidate review gate and integration refused it. Sidequest now rebinds that identity on the executor's next board call, which every run makes to claim and to close, and only the exact reserved worktree binds. The shared checkout, a sibling or foreign target, a foreign agent, an ambiguous or terminal attempt, a replaced checkout, and a changed revision all stay unbound.
- Preserve delayed phase exit during cleanup (SQ-2166)
  Sidequest now keeps one phase exit from an already-started phase valid while timeout cleanup is in progress. Other post-timeout control traffic remains a protocol error.

## v3.466.2 (2026-08-16)

Hotfix release cut from `main`.

### sidequest 4.50.4 → 4.50.5

### sidequest 4.50.1 → 4.50.2

#### Fixes

- Stabilize owned-process deadline checks (SQ-2127)
  Stabilized the exact-deadline process ownership check so CI consistently verifies descendant cleanup without affecting unrelated processes.
- Isolate submission tests from gateway state (SQ-2128)
  Submission lifecycle tests now use a fixed available route instead of local Model Gateway readiness.

## v3.464.0 (2026-08-15)

### sidequest 4.50.0 → 4.50.1

#### Fixes

- Fix linked worktree dispatch (SQ-2129)
  Linked worktree dispatches now bind to the registered project board.

## v3.463.0 (2026-08-15)

### model-gateway 0.48.6 → 0.48.7

#### Fixes

- Self-heal the shared model proxy (SQ-1996)
  Model Gateway's shim supervisor now checks proxy readiness, recovers an unavailable proxy with bounded single-flight backoff, and records timestamped recovery evidence.

### observability 0.7.9 → 0.7.10

#### Fixes

- Keep local telemetry ingesting during dashboard recovery (SQ-1954)
  Keep the observer and SQLite ingestion running when Docker or Grafana is unavailable, and report dashboard port drift without changing the dashboard container.
- Preserve telemetry storage headroom (SQ-1963)
  Observability now preserves writable SQLite headroom before its database cap, reports pressure actions and unrecoverable storage failures, and checks free disk space before a full manual vacuum.
- Start local telemetry before optional dashboard checks (SQ-2125)
  Observability now starts its local observer and collector before checking dashboard availability. When Docker is unavailable, dashboard activity lookup and provisioning are skipped while local telemetry continues to start.

### quartermaster 0.5.2 → 0.5.3

#### Fixes

- Remove the retired retro runtime alias (SQ-1966)
  Quartermaster no longer accepts the retired `mark-retro` command. Use `mark-resupply`.

### sidequest 4.49.0 → 4.50.0

#### Features

- Centralize project-neutral lifecycle transitions (SQ-1915)
  Sidequest now runs dispatched, direct, Git-backed, and immutable source-revision work through explicit lifecycle paths. Projects without Git, processes, or worktrees can submit, verify, integrate, and close reviewed revisions without invoking those adapters.
- Replace split worktree ownership with one lease (SQ-1917)
  Sidequest now admits worktree cleanup only through a terminal, identity-bound lease for a canonical registered worktree. Unknown, live, locked, unregistered, and reparse-point worktrees stay protected.
- Bind revision facts to hydrated candidates (SQ-1947)
  Sidequest now admits Git and immutable source revisions through one kernel decision. Source-revision retries restore the checkpointed candidate before one server-owned capability call, bind unavailable and successful facts to that candidate and its dispatch baseline, and prevent stale resolver registrations from returning after teardown.
- Make review binding transactional (SQ-2038)
  Sidequest binds a `review-audit` ticket to the exact candidate it reviews through one transactional
  transition. `add` and `update` take a `reviewTarget` (reviewed ref plus the submitted commit or source
  revision) and the store commits the review's `reviewTarget` and the source submission's `review` mirror
  inside a single storage transaction, so a failure between the two writes leaves neither side bound. No
  generic field or patch can set, change, or clear the binding, and retargeting needs a fresh review ticket.

  A bound candidate is frozen: reclaim, amendment, `clearSubmission`, and supersede fail closed, including
  on a legacy one-sided binding, and integration waits for the bound review to terminally complete. Dispatch
  revalidates the binding and pins the review to that exact immutable commit in an isolated checkout.
  Confirming a defect with `rework --review-ref` (by an identity other than the submitter) rejects the
  candidate permanently and forces a fresh ticket, attempt, commit, and review for the repair.
- Remove public candidate rejection (SQ-2120)
  Sidequest no longer lets any public route permanently reject a candidate that is bound to a
  `review-audit` ticket. `recordSubmissionRejection`, `reworkSubmission`, raw MCP `rework`, CLI `rework`,
  and reconciliation of a matching pending rejection all return one pre-write `candidate_review_locked`
  refusal, whatever `by` or `reviewRef` says, and neither half of the binding changes. There is no
  authenticated release principal to check: a handler sees nothing but caller-supplied JSON, so `by`,
  session labels, and publish-lock strings are all forgeable and none of them can stand in for one.
  `reviewRef` is still accepted and is now ignored.

  A review that finds a real defect records its evidence on the review ticket and releases that review with
  `kind=oracle`. The source submission, its `review` mirror, the review's `reviewTarget`, and the candidate
  commit stay byte-identical, integration stays blocked, and repair goes through a fresh ticket, dispatch,
  claim, commit, review, and candidate. `rework` still bounces an UNBOUND candidate back to `todo` for its
  owner, and historical rejected records stay readable and keep blocking integration.

  Integration now reads both runtime identities from the immutable terminal dispatch attempts instead of the
  mutable current dispatch: the source's `submitted` attempt for that exact commit and the review's terminal
  `done` attempt. A later prepared dispatch cannot rewrite that selection. A missing attempt, a missing agent
  id on either side, or the same agent id on both leaves integration blocked with `candidate_review_required`.

#### Fixes

- Keep board watches project-local (SQ-1925)
  Board watches now keep their notifications scoped to the selected project, so unrelated board activity cannot wake a Claude session.
- Retire terminal Sidequest teammates (SQ-1952)
  Sidequest now retires completed native teammates after preserving their terminal board handoff, so finished work no longer stays in the session roster.
- Restore auto-release recovery guidance (SQ-1953)
  Sidequest now tells an executor whose claim was auto-released how to recover the preserved commit.
- Refuse stale Sidequest mutations (SQ-1956)
  Sidequest now refuses board writes before they create work from a stale loaded plugin, naming the loaded and installed versions and directing agents to `/reload-plugins`. Reads remain available for diagnosis.
- Fold sibling warning paths (SQ-1958)
  Fold repetitive same-basename sibling warnings while retaining the full path set through board context retrieval.
- Pin story decisions in dispatch briefings (SQ-1960)
  Dispatch briefings now carry the exact story decision-log revision prepared for the ticket and identify later changes correctly.
- Make Sidequest full gate gateway-independent (SQ-1965)
  Sidequest's full test gate now uses its own ready Model Gateway catalog fixture, so it does not depend on a live local gateway.
- Wait for active waves before integration (SQ-1967)
  Sidequest waits for live claims in a submitted story wave to finish before reminding the orchestrator to integrate.
- Bind isolated worktrees before mutation (SQ-1968)
  Sidequest now reserves an isolated checkout against its dispatch before Git creates it, verifies the host-reported checkout when the executor starts, and refuses writes from unbound lookalike worktrees.
- Resolve delivery reachability against the live integration revision (SQ-1970)
  Hand-delivered Sidequest closures now retain the exact integration revision they checked, including commits added after the board started.
- Emit unchanged board warnings once (SQ-1971)
  Board watches now avoid repeating unchanged warnings after unrelated ticket updates while still delivering changed warning facts.
- Refuse invalid child shared-tree dispatches (SQ-1973)
  Shared-tree dispatch now requires the real project checkout, and executor-held claims cannot start child dispatches or a second live claim.
- Recover pre-claim dispatch retries (SQ-1975)
  Recover terminal dispatches that stopped before claiming while preserving worktree candidates with real progress.
- Keep test fixture boards private (SQ-1976)
  Sidequest test runs now use a private board home, so fixture projects no longer appear in your dashboard.
- Bind leases to checkout instances (SQ-1978)
  Sidequest now binds each isolated worktree lease to the checkout instance created for its dispatch. Recreating a linked checkout at the same path no longer inherits write or cleanup authority.
- Make claim identity transport-neutral (SQ-1986)
  Sidequest claim admission now resolves token files once in the store and validates the exact prepared executor consistently for CLI and MCP claims.
- Repair merged typecheck blockers (SQ-1989)
  Sidequest's merged lifecycle code now typechecks after preserving nullable story-warning boundaries and the canonical active dispatch route name.
- Restore EnterWorktree repository folding (SQ-1994)
  Sidequest now anchors EnterWorktree checkouts to their owning repository.
- Keep Sidequest skill loading lean (SQ-1995)
  Ticket-authoring detail now loads on demand, keeping the always-loaded Sidequest skill within its session budget.
- Reject stale provider catalogs (SQ-2000)
  Sidequest only advertises ready Model Gateway routes from fresh catalogs, keeping routing and the live model list aligned.
- Canonicalize prepared executor identity (SQ-2003)
  Sidequest now hydrates one canonical prepared-dispatch executor identity across briefing, claim admission, guidance, and lifecycle adapters.
- Enforce terminal cleanup authority (SQ-2009)
  Sidequest now removes isolated checkouts only when the store recorded a terminal lifecycle transition and the checkout still matches its completed WorktreeCreate identity. Nonterminal, markerless, recreated, ambiguous sibling, and mismatched checkouts are preserved.
- Fix CLI delivery closure (SQ-2011)
  `groom-close --delivery-commit` now delegates delivery validation and closure to the shared store transition instead of crashing on a private helper.
- Align readonly dispatch checkout (SQ-2014)
  Read-only dispatches now default to an isolated checkout, so their Agent spawn and briefing agree when an orchestrator is already in a linked worktree.
- Accept merge delivery lineage (SQ-2016)
  Reviewed hand-delivered repairs now derive merge delivery paths from the first parent delta, so valid recovery supersession stays available.
- Enforce exact dispatch launch (SQ-2028)
  Dispatch executors now require the exact current prepared briefing command before their launch is recorded.
- Repair usable-route recovery guidance (SQ-2035)
  Sidequest now keeps unavailable routes inline and requires Board MCP reconnect and fresh dispatch for lifecycle recovery.
- Stop false unchecked CI events (SQ-2049)
  Sidequest's board watch now decides whether the tracked remote head is green only from completed successful runs for that exact SHA. A local branch ahead of its upstream cannot turn a terminal-green historical head into an actionable unchecked event.
- Document bounded build checks (SQ-2057)
  Sidequest's TypeScript rewrite contract now documents isolated generated-output checks and bounded build process cleanup.
- Fail cleanup signal errors (SQ-2070)
  Sidequest now treats owner cleanup signal failures as failed full-gate phases and rejects malformed, duplicate, or out-of-state diagnostics with `EPROTO`.
- Pin surgical planning before dispatch (SQ-2073)
  Sidequest now pins a visible surgical planning contract before substantial or ambiguous feature work dispatches, with bounded review and re-planning rules in its shipped guidance.
- Ban implementer self-review explicitly (SQ-2087)
  Sidequest implementation executors now explicitly leave review of their own candidates to the orchestrator, alongside the existing ban on controlling candidate review tickets.
- Preserve ignored path bytes (SQ-2095)
  Sidequest now keeps ignored paths NUL-delimited through linked-worktree visibility checks, including names with quotes and newlines.
- Refuse dirty integration targets (SQ-2105)
  Sidequest now refuses integration into targets with staged, unstaged, untracked, or unmerged checkout state.
- Close normalized delivered legacy scope (SQ-2108)
  Sidequest can close delivered legacy submissions with only an empty or normalized root scope, while preserving exact target reachability and concrete scope checks.

## v3.462.0 (2026-08-13)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.2 → 2.15.3

#### Fixes

- Permit bounded readonly artifacts (SQ-1843)
  Readonly artifact dispatches can write their declared map scope while Sidequest refuses every other project path.
- Stop lock teardown is race-safe (SQ-1903)
  Make Stop-veto lock release tolerate concurrent directory entries during teardown.

### observability 0.7.8 → 0.7.9

#### Fixes

- Cap dense Grafana charts (SQ-1909)
  Grafana usage dashboards now auto-size time buckets and cap dense cost and context charts at 120 points, so week-long views do not swamp the browser.

### quartermaster 0.5.1 → 0.5.2

#### Fixes

- Add approved optimization rounds (SQ-1908)
  Quartermaster now proactively offers a focused development-setup optimization round and waits for current approval unless the user has explicitly granted standing permission. Sidequest now keeps specific one-file and one-prompt requests inline by default, while requiring approval before proactive or expanded work unless standing permission covers it.

### sidequest 4.48.1 → 4.49.0

#### Features

- Warn before isolated dispatches fork stale main (SQ-1890)

#### Fixes

- Permit bounded readonly artifacts (SQ-1843)
  Readonly artifact dispatches can write their declared map scope while Sidequest refuses every other project path.
- Keep review dispatches on the shared checkout (SQ-1857)
  Executor briefings now name their local CLI fallback, review-audit dispatches use the shared checkout by default, and isolated executors can inspect it with read-only Git commands.
- Restore read-only external output dispatch (SQ-1874)
  Sidequest restores the read-only external-output dispatch route.
- Preserve control-plane comment authors (SQ-1892)
  Control-plane comments now retain their own author identity instead of appearing to come from an active executor.
- Clarify attestation artifact mismatch errors (SQ-1897)
  Attestation verify errors now show the expected artifact prefix and the submitted first segment.
- Name processes blocking worktree cleanup (SQ-1898)
  Worktree cleanup now identifies Windows processes that still reference a directory it could not remove.
- Stop terminal executor tool calls (SQ-1902)
  Terminal executor tool calls now stop with the board's recorded closeout evidence.
- Clarify board dispatch authorization (SQ-1904)
  Enabled Sidequest boards now explicitly authorize executor dispatch, require visible notice when substantive work stays inline, and allow a 4 KB SessionStart context so the full operating contract and prioritized workforce survive together.
- Parallel orchestration guidance (SQ-1905)
  Sidequest now tells orchestrators to split independent item sweeps into concurrent shard tickets while keeping dependent and shared-design work together.
- Watch GitHub CI (SQ-1906)
  `sidequest watch` now reports failed GitHub Actions runs and heads that have not reached a green run.
- Continue compatible dispatches after upgrades (SQ-1907)
  Sidequest sessions with claim self-heal now continue dispatching across a newer compatible installed version while recording and reporting the skew. Unknown, schema-incompatible, and older loaded versions still require a reload.
- Add approved optimization rounds (SQ-1908)
  Quartermaster now proactively offers a focused development-setup optimization round and waits for current approval unless the user has explicitly granted standing permission. Sidequest now keeps specific one-file and one-prompt requests inline by default, while requiring approval before proactive or expanded work unless standing permission covers it.

## v3.461.0 (2026-08-13)

### sidequest 4.48.0 → 4.48.1

#### Fixes

- Keep executor release fragment scope in sync (SQ-1845)
  Let dispatched executors create the release fragment their submission needs.
- Configure Python UTF-8 during dispatch (SQ-1862)
  Sidequest dispatch now configures UTF-8 Python output for Windows projects that contain Python sources.
- Ignore heredoc prose in Git safety guard (SQ-1869)
  Git safety checks now ignore commit-message heredoc bodies while continuing to block executable release commands.
- Explain shared-tree fallback for refused isolation spawns (SQ-1871)
  Dispatch guidance now names the deliberate shared-tree fallback when Claude Code refuses an isolated worktree, and reclaims untouched unclaimed worktrees before replacement dispatches.
- Allow bounded dispatch diagnostics (SQ-1872)
  Adds a read-only, three-turn diagnostic probe for checking the dispatch path when ticket dispatch is unavailable.
- Keep shared dispatch scope bindings grow-only (SQ-1873)
- Fix Sidequest submission range remedies (SQ-1875)
- Fix Sidequest hand-delivery closure guidance (SQ-1876)
- Restored sessions are told stale task reminders are stale (SQ-1877)
  The context-restored orchestrator briefing now says that a restored window replays background-task reminders which can name already-finished agents, so the board is the authority and those names are not worth an investigation round.
- Accept a body file on add and update, and refuse unsupported flags (SQ-1878)
  `sidequest add` and `sidequest update` now read a description from `--body-file`, the same way `comment`, `done`, and `submit` already did. Every command also refuses a flag it does not support instead of discarding it silently, so a misapplied flag can no longer leave a ticket written with a missing field.
- Preserve a SessionStart worktree from its own sweep (SQ-1879)
  SessionStart worktree cleanup now keeps the linked worktree running that session, even when the board resolves its project to the main checkout.
- Submit preserved work after worktree cleanup (SQ-1880)
  Submit now validates a reachable pinned commit from the board repository when its executor worktree has been swept. Its two remaining dead-end refusals, an undeclared file scope and a commit it cannot inspect, now name the handback an executor can actually perform instead of stopping at the diagnosis.
- Accept harness worktrees from linked sessions (SQ-1881)
  Sidequest now accepts an executor worktree that Claude Code creates under the invoking linked worktree.
- Keep verified work off user handoffs (SQ-1882)
  Executors now record evidence-backed blockers instead of handing commands to an absent user, and orchestrators are told how to deliver verified work when a board path refuses it.
- Heal version-skewed dispatch claims (SQ-1884)
  Token-valid dispatch claims now refresh a stale executor name after a Sidequest update.
- Watch actionable board events (SQ-1889)
  Adds `sidequest watch` for orchestrators to receive scope requests, blockers, liveness failures, and other actionable board events through Claude Code Monitor.
- Add executor survival guidance to briefings (SQ-1891)
  Executor briefings now tell routed workers to verify early, submit verified partial work, and commit before their run ends.

### workbench 0.88.1 → 0.88.2

#### Fixes

- Report stale worktree processes (SQ-1864)
  Toolshed Doctor now reports Windows processes whose command lines still reference a swept project or Sidequest worktree.

## v3.460.0 (2026-08-13)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.1 → 2.15.2

#### Fixes

- Refresh small maps inline (SQ-1858)
  Small codebase map refreshes now run inline. Large structural changes still use the map handoff.

### observability 0.7.7 → 0.7.8

#### Fixes

- Reliable hook spool draining (SQ-1849)
  Hook spool draining now has enough time for busy Windows runners and reports remaining entries if it times out.

### quartermaster 0.5.0 → 0.5.1

#### Fixes

- Learn repeated permission approvals (SQ-1859)
  Quartermaster can now opt into learning repeatedly approved safe permission rules for each project.

### sidequest 4.47.2 → 4.48.0

#### Features

- Oracle parking, a terminal state for human-verdict waits (SQ-1856)
  An executor that needs a human judgement call no longer has to sit on its claim waiting for
  one. `release` takes a new kind, `oracle`, which parks the ticket as `awaiting-oracle` and
  requires an ask stating what the human must decide; releasing with `oracle` and no ask is
  refused. The parked ask, and the verdict once it exists, ride along in the executor briefing
  on the next dispatch, and the release-kind guidance names the new option.

#### Fixes

- Refuse external declared files (SQ-1852)
  Sidequest now rejects declared files outside the repository before dispatch.
- Claim scope shedding (SQ-1853)
  Claim holders can remove incorrectly declared paths while their work is active.
- Ignore unbound dispatch retries (SQ-1854)
  Dispatch retries that never bound no longer trigger the repeat-failure guard, and now explain how to recover the binding.
- Board API friendlier arguments (SQ-1855)
  Board calls now accept common argument aliases, suggest close parameter names, and offer compact list output.
- Retry busy SQLite mutations (SQ-1860)
  Sidequest now waits longer for SQLite writers and retries bounded busy top-level mutations before surfacing a lock error.
- Report story contract byte overage (SQ-1861)
  Oversized story execution contracts now report their measured UTF-8 size and the number of bytes over capacity.
- Configurable dispatch worktree base (SQ-1863)
  Boards can now choose whether isolated dispatches start from origin/main or local main.
- Warn isolated agents about heredocs (SQ-1867)
  The harness refuses heredocs inside an isolated worktree, so a new PreToolUse guard catches
  one before the harness does and tells the agent to write the script to its scratchpad and run
  it by path. The CLI help stopped recommending heredocs for multi-line `-d`/`-m` values too; it
  now names `$'...\n...'` as the form that works everywhere.
- Preserve repeated CLI scope flags (SQ-1870)
  Repeated `--files` values now preserve every declared scope path.

## v3.459.0 (2026-08-12)

### sidequest 4.47.1 → 4.47.2

#### Fixes

- Fix briefing --token-file rejecting every executor with a missing nonce (SQ-1866)
  The token-file dispatch flow shipped in 4.47.0 never worked end to end: `briefing --token-file` validated the token, then rendered with the raw `--token` option, which is empty in token-file mode, so every executor's mandatory first command threw "dispatch briefing nonce is required". The briefing now renders with the token the store resolved from the file, and the regression test spawns the compiled CLI the way an executor does, which is the seam the old store-level test missed.

## v3.458.0 (2026-08-12)

### sidequest 4.47.0 → 4.47.1

#### Fixes

- Refuse irrecoverable unscoped dispatches (SQ-1846)
  Dispatch now refuses write-capable tickets with no declared files when the board has no automatic scope policy that can grant the executor's first request. Read-only work, explicit unscoped overrides, and boards with matching automatic scope policies keep working.
- Keep isolated dispatch worktrees bound to one ticket (SQ-1847)
  Concurrent isolated dispatches with the same runtime identity now refuse an ambiguous multi-bind instead of stamping one agent worktree on every ticket.
- Preserve dirty worktrees (SQ-1848)
  Worktree sweeps keep reachable worktrees with tracked uncommitted changes.
- Guard the patch-equivalent sweep branch against uncommitted work too (SQ-1850)
  The sweep learned to preserve a worktree holding uncommitted tracked edits, but only on the reachable branch. A worktree whose commits are already upstream by content, without its own commit being an ancestor, still went through the patch-equivalent branch and took the edits with it. Both settled-branch removals are guarded now.
- Stop local suite runs from borrowing the developer's Claude session (SQ-1851)
  A suite run started from inside Claude Code inherited a real session and agent id, and CI has neither. A claim that never passed `--session` bound off that ambient identity and went green locally while CI refused it as `unbound_dispatch`. The hermetic suite environment now strips `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`, `CLAUDE_SESSION_ID`, `SIDEQUEST_SESSION` and `SIDEQUEST_AGENT`, so a local `npm run test:full` and the release cut both run identity-free like CI. A test that needs an identity sets its own.

## v3.457.0 (2026-08-12)

### observability 0.7.6 → 0.7.7

#### Fixes

- Declare the observability suite timeout in its manifest (SQ-1828)
  The observability suite can exceed Node's 120s per-file test timeout on Windows CI runners. The timeout is now declared as suiteTimeout in the plugin manifest, so every consumer of the suite resolver agrees: the CI matrix, the release cut's verification, and the board's verify command.

### sidequest 4.46.1 → 4.47.0

#### Features

- Pass dispatch credentials by token file (SQ-1834) [`07c96d9`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/07c96d96)
  An executor no longer has to retype a dispatch token into a shell command. The credential is handed over by file, so a model that drops, reorders, or truncates a character in the command can no longer fail its own claim.

#### Fixes

- Show MCP tools/list budget use (SQ-1833)
  Sidequest now prints the MCP tools/list payload, reserve, remaining headroom, and per-tool byte use after a build. The dispatched tool schema again explains recovery evidence and labels the dispatch result.
- Say why a scope request was refused, and document --file (SQ-1846)
  A ticket that declares no files refuses every scope request it can ever make, because package scope is derived from the declared roots. The refusal comment used to name only the refused paths and tell the executor to hand back, so the run ended and the orchestrator re-derived the cause by hand. It now says the ticket declares no files and names the one command that fixes it.

  The CLI help for `add` and `update` never mentioned `--file`, though both have accepted it all along. An orchestrator reading `--help` concluded the CLI could not declare file scope at all and filed unscoped write tickets through it. Both usage lines now carry it, and `add` says what happens to a write ticket without it.

### workbench 0.88.0 → 0.88.1

#### Fixes

- Refuse unconfigured Python packages (SQ-1841)
  Workbench code intelligence now asks for a package virtual environment instead of using system Python for packages that declare dependencies.

## v3.456.0 (2026-08-12)

### quartermaster 0.4.1 → 0.5.0

#### Features

- Add C++ code intelligence (SQ-1840)
  Workbench can use clangd for C and C++ when the project supplies a current compile database.

### workbench 0.87.0 → 0.88.0

#### Features

- Add Python code intelligence (SQ-1837)
  Add Pyright code intelligence with package-aware Python interpreter resolution.
- Add C++ code intelligence (SQ-1840)
  Workbench can use clangd for C and C++ when the project supplies a current compile database.

## v3.455.0 (2026-08-12)

### quartermaster 0.4.0 → 0.4.1

#### Fixes

- Generalize code-intel tools across languages (SQ-1836) [`94e32b0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/94e32b07)
  Generalized the code-intel MCP tools from typescript_definition, typescript_references, and typescript_diagnostics to definition, references, and diagnostics; each call now selects its language server from the requested file extension. Client registry keys by (root, language) so one root can host several servers. Quartermaster setup reference updated to the new tool names.

### workbench 0.86.2 → 0.87.0

#### Features

- Generalize code-intel tools across languages (SQ-1836) [`94e32b0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/94e32b07)
  Generalized the code-intel MCP tools from typescript_definition, typescript_references, and typescript_diagnostics to definition, references, and diagnostics; each call now selects its language server from the requested file extension. Client registry keys by (root, language) so one root can host several servers. Quartermaster setup reference updated to the new tool names.

## v3.454.0 (2026-08-12)

### sidequest 4.46.0 → 4.46.1

#### Fixes

- Make dispatch tokens easier to copy (SQ-1830)
  Dispatch tokens now use grouped lowercase characters and explain how to recover from a transcription mistake.
- Recover unclaimed dispatches (SQ-1831)
  Dispatch can supersede a launched executor that never bound, claimed, or checkpointed when the orchestrator records the failed-claim evidence.
- Restore dispatch route labels (SQ-1832)
  Running executor rows again show the readable model and effort label.

## v3.453.0 (2026-08-11)

### sidequest 4.45.0 → 4.46.0

#### Features

- Agent-list rows stop showing raw route markers (SQ-1827)
  FleetView showed two kinds of executor labels: the readable "GPT-5.6 Sol, high · <title>" next to a raw "[sidequest-route ...]" tag. The board stored a proper description in both cases; Claude Code previews the prompt's first line for some rows, and the dispatch stub put the route marker there. The marker now rides at the end of the stub (the gateway's marker scan is position-independent, only the count matters), so any first-line preview shows "Implementation context:" and the ticket title. agentSpawn also strips markers embedded anywhere in a supplied label instead of only rejecting exact-match ones, falling back to the generic label only when nothing readable remains.

## v3.452.0 (2026-08-11)

### workbench 0.86.1 → 0.86.2

#### Fixes

- Doctor audit stops reporting a healthy model gateway as down (SQ-1826)
  The session-start audit parsed the model-gateway doctor's output with regexes that no longer matched its healthy phrasings: the proxy line says "answering /v1/models" (not "running"), and the version line carries the binary name before the number. Every healthy gateway reported "proxy or router is down" plus "proxy is missing or has no readable version". The parser now accepts the real phrasings, and a drift test pins them against the model-gateway source so a rewording fails the suite instead of shipping a false alarm.

## v3.451.0 (2026-08-11)

### sidequest 4.44.2 → 4.45.0

#### Features

- Scope grants now reach re-dispatches and post-release submits (SQ-1825)
  Files declared after an executor handback now enter the next dispatch's binding (the released binding is unioned with the current effective scope instead of replacing it), and the submit gate stops enforcing a terminal dispatch's frozen binding: once a dispatch is dead, admitted scope comes from the ticket's current files, matching what pulse already reports. Previously a path the orchestrator declared and granted mid-ticket stayed refused through every later submit and had to ship as an out-of-band commit (the-bot-resurrection SQ-825, three refused submits).

## v3.450.0 (2026-08-11)

### codebase-mapper 2.15.0 → 2.15.1

#### Fixes

- Stabilize Stop hook concurrency checks (SQ-1823)
  Made Codebase Mapper's concurrent Stop hook checks reliable on busy CI runners.

## v3.449.0 (2026-08-11)

### codebase-mapper 2.14.4 → 2.15.0

#### Features

- Mapper skills get the map committed, .map-state.json included (SQ-1824)
  Both skills now commit the map themselves (outside shared-tree artifact mode) instead of reminding the user, explicitly including `.map-state.json`, and detect the broad `.claude/*` gitignore that made `git add` warn and agents wrongly treat the map as local-only, adding the `.codebase-info` negations in the same commit.

## v3.448.0 (2026-08-11)

### quartermaster 0.3.0 → 0.4.0

#### Features

- Carry the capability-capture charter into every session and run resupply proactively (SQ-1822)
  The SessionStart hook now keeps the capability-capture charter in front of Claude (turn the task done three times into a skill, map entry, rule, or measurement, offered in the moment), stepping aside where setup seeded the per-prompt live rule. The resupply nudge has Claude run the pass at the next natural pause instead of merely suggesting it, and fires sooner: 4 sessions / 6 friction events / 24h cooldown.

## v3.447.0 (2026-08-11)

### observability 0.7.5 → 0.7.6

#### Fixes

- Drop idle projects from the Cost by project panel (SQ-1821)
  Projects with no priced usage in the window no longer render as permanent $0.00 rows in the Cost by project legend and tooltips.

## v3.446.0 (2026-08-11)

### observability 0.7.4 → 0.7.5

#### Fixes

- Keep recharge rollups responsive (SQ-1818)
  Keep session-end recharge rollups from blocking telemetry ingestion on long sessions.
- Resume partially drained hook spools (SQ-1819)
  Hook spool drains now keep committed rows out of later attempts and report drains that remain stuck past their deadline.

## v3.445.0 (2026-08-11)

### model-gateway 0.48.5 → 0.48.6

#### Fixes

- Refresh model gateway catalogs (SQ-1269)
  Model Gateway now advertises current Codex and Grok subscription models, using the Grok CLI cache when available.

### sidequest 4.44.1 → 4.44.2

#### Fixes

- Preserve retained continuation checkpoints during worktree sync (SQ-1745)

## v3.444.0 (2026-08-11)

### quartermaster 0.2.2 → 0.3.0

#### Features

- /quartermaster:retro becomes /quartermaster:resupply, and asks what would make the work easier (SQ-1815)
  **The command changed: `/quartermaster:retro` is now `/quartermaster:resupply`.** Your session tallies and decision ledger carry over untouched, including the timestamp of your last pass.

  The old skill was a friction hunt: count the denials, the corrections, the interrupts, the commands you kept retyping, then fix those. That misses the improvements that matter most, because the best ones leave no trace. When you need a measurement that doesn't exist yet, nothing errors, nothing gets denied, nobody corrects you, and you only do it once, so every "did this happen repeatedly" threshold skips right past it. Removing friction gets you back to the speed you already expected. Adding a capability moves that baseline.

  So the pass now starts from what you're actually trying to get done, then looks for what's missing against it, in value order: something you have no way to measure, work you keep doing by hand, knowledge you keep re-deriving, and only then the setup pushing back at you. Findings route to a new destination list that puts a measurement built as a committed skill at the top and permissions near the bottom, with a project-knowledge destination that didn't exist before.

  A goal phrased as a standard ("make it reliable", "make sure the output is correct") is the case this is really aimed at. You can't close one of those without a way to check it, so every fix underneath stays a guess and the same argument reopens a week later. That missing ruler is now the highest-value thing the skill can propose.

  Hence the name. A quartermaster keeps a unit supplied: `setup` outfits a new workspace, and `resupply` works out what an existing one is short of and gets it. "Retro" pointed backwards at what went wrong, which is exactly the frame this drops.

  The self-improvement live rule that quartermaster installs on every workspace got the same treatment, and both it and the skill now send new skills through skill-creator instead of suggesting it in passing. Hand-rolled skill files tend to encode the one example in front of you and end up too vague to trigger when you need them.

  Value order is where the pass *looks*, not the order it *proposes* in. A missing measurement leads only when the history actually attests it: a goal restated and never met, a check improvised dozens of times, one question answered two different ways. Read off a single session title plus a habit, it gets labelled as inference and ranks below the cheap fixes you can be sure about, and on a project holding no standard at all the honest answer is that there's nothing to build. That distinction came out of running the skill against three sandboxed histories: without it, a project shipping steadily against a working test suite got an invented measurement gap ranked first, above two well-evidenced fixes.

  Numbers quoted back at you are now the aggregate's numbers as it reports them, and nothing gets shown as a command that was run unless it was. The whole point of mining is that you don't have to take the pass on trust.

## v3.443.0 (2026-08-11)

### observability 0.7.3 → 0.7.4

#### Fixes

- Raise the observability database cap to 4GB (SQ-1813)
  The 1 GB cap was passed within two days on a machine writing about 625 MB of telemetry a day, and 30-day retention could never bring it back under. The default is now 4 GB, so size pruning starts roughly a week in rather than immediately, and it drops whole oldest days when it does.

## v3.442.0 (2026-08-11)

### observability 0.7.2 → 0.7.3

#### Fixes

- Keep observer hook-spool failures visible (SQ-1812)
  Observer hook-spool drain failures now log their cause, appear in health, yield between batches, and move repeated failures into a dated poison file.
- Prune the observability database by size, without stalling the observer (SQ-1813)
  Retention pruning could never bring a database back under its 1 GB cap, so the file only grew. Pruning now also drops the oldest days once the cap is passed, a few days per pass so it never blocks ingest, and `/toolshed-doctor` reports the storage block instead of skipping it. Reclaiming the file space runs `VACUUM`, which takes about a minute per 2 GB, so only the `prune-observability` CLI does that.

### workbench 0.86.0 → 0.86.1

#### Fixes

- Prune the observability database by size, without stalling the observer (SQ-1813)
  Retention pruning could never bring a database back under its 1 GB cap, so the file only grew. Pruning now also drops the oldest days once the cap is passed, a few days per pass so it never blocks ingest, and `/toolshed-doctor` reports the storage block instead of skipping it. Reclaiming the file space runs `VACUUM`, which takes about a minute per 2 GB, so only the `prune-observability` CLI does that.

## v3.441.0 (2026-08-10)

### quartermaster 0.2.1 → 0.2.2

#### Fixes

- Retire Codegraph (SQ-1812)
  Codegraph is gone: the plugin, its marketplace entry, its docs page, and its MCP server. It never earned its keep next to the tools already in the shed. Grep, LSP, and Codebase Mapper cover the same ground without a pinned Pyright, a pinned TypeScript, a SQLite graph, and a 16-second query.

  Nothing else depended on it. Quartermaster's setup skill no longer has to explain why not to recommend it.

  If you have it installed, remove it in `/plugin` and delete `~/.claude/codegraph` (the graph snapshots and the pinned runtimes, which run to a gigabyte or so). Nothing else on disk is left behind.

## v3.440.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.3.0 → 0.4.0

#### Features

- Codegraph never indexes worktrees, nested checkouts, or virtual environments (SQ-1811)
  Codegraph indexes your project's source and nothing that merely sits inside it. An agent worktree, a nested clone, a submodule, or a virtual environment is now excluded by one shared policy that reaches project discovery, freshness, the Pyright config, and the TypeScript source filter.

  A worktree used to be skipped only because Pyright excludes dot-directories by default, so a worktree root at any other path would have landed in the graph as a second stale copy of every symbol. Worktrees are recognized two ways, because one is not enough: a `worktrees` or `.worktrees` directory by name, and any directory carrying its own `.git` file or directory. A copied worktree carries no git marker; a worktree placed outside the conventional directory carries no conventional name.

  Virtual environments are found by `pyvenv.cfg` rather than by name, so an environment called anything is still excluded. It remains a resolution input, so imports into installed packages still resolve, but its files never become graph nodes.

  Codegraph now passes its exclusions to Pyright explicitly, including the three Pyright would otherwise supply on its own, because supplying any exclusion silently drops those defaults. Your project's own `exclude` still applies and is added to, never replaced.

## v3.439.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.2.0 → 0.3.0

#### Features

- Python indexing actually reaches the shipped MCP entrypoint (SQ-1730)
  Python support landed in 0.2.0 complete and unreachable: bin/codegraph-mcp.js was hand-written JavaScript beside a src/bin TypeScript copy that nothing compiled, and only the hand-written one shipped. It never registered PythonLanguageProvider, so a Python project indexed to an empty snapshot with no error. bin/ is now generated from src/bin, build-check hashes it, and the provider list moved to one factory both the source and the compiled artifact are tested against.

#### Fixes

- Freshness stops walking virtualenvs and build caches on every query (SQ-1808)
  Each language kept its own ignore list, so the TypeScript contributor re-walked a Python project's whole virtualenv on every status and every query. Both contributors now share one policy that probes for pyvenv.cfg rather than trusting directory names, while keeping their language-specific extras.

### model-gateway 0.48.4 → 0.48.5

#### Fixes

- Gateway setup no longer crashes when wiring lives outside the selected scope, and unwire keeps alias pins it never wrote (SQ-1806)
  isWired() and wiredMode() disagreed once a project wired itself in its own settings.local.json: setup threw 'Cannot read properties of null (reading scope)', and compat-mode sync silently stopped. wiredMode() now resolves through the same precedence and reports the file-backed definition a write can actually change. Separately, `env --remove` deleted every ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL key by name; it now removes a pin only when it still holds a value the gateway wrote.

### sidequest 4.44.0 → 4.44.1

#### Fixes

- An empty dispatch binding no longer overrides the ticket's declared files (SQ-1807)
  A dispatch that captured no files was treated as an authoritative empty scope, because Array.isArray([]) is true. The commit gate then saw an empty effective scope beside a non-empty ticket.files, appended the release fragment, and demanded `.release/unreleased/<REF>.md` as the only path in scope, in projects with no such convention. A released dispatch also handed its empty binding to the next attempt, so re-dispatch never re-read the ticket and editing its files changed nothing. Cost three executor runs on one ticket before it was root-caused.

## v3.438.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.7 → 0.2.0

#### Features

- Codegraph resolves Python imports through the project virtual environment (SQ-1792)
  Codegraph now hands the discovered Python dependency environment to Pyright, so imports from installed packages resolve to their declarations instead of stopping at the project edge. A project with a virtual environment produces resolved import, alias, and reference edges where it previously produced none.

#### Fixes

- Preserve Codegraph index failures across restarts (SQ-1788)
  Codegraph keeps a failed index status and its reason after an MCP server or session restart until a later index succeeds.

### quartermaster 0.2.0 → 0.2.1

#### Fixes

- Quartermaster setup explains what each Toolshed plugin is (SQ-1798)
  The setup skill now describes what each Toolshed plugin does before the reason to install it, so Claude can explain a proposal instead of only naming it. It also says plainly that every piece is independent and opt-in, and that Sidequest is the routing and executor system rather than a ticket tracker.

### sidequest 4.43.0 → 4.44.0

#### Features

- Give an already-delivered ticket a way to close (SQ-1794)
  A ticket whose work already landed on the integration branch could reach a state where every lifecycle call refused and named another that also refused. `groomClose` now accepts the delivery commit for work integrated by hand, and terminal-agent evidence for clearing a dead dispatch. The refusals that formed the ring name that exit, so an orchestrator finds it from the message it is already reading.

### workbench 0.85.0 → 0.86.0

#### Features

- Rename workbench-doctor to toolshed-doctor (SQ-1796)
  The health-check skill is now `/toolshed-doctor`. It checks every installed Toolshed plugin rather than Workbench alone, and it reads as a pair with `/update-toolshed`. The old `/workbench-doctor` name is gone with no alias, so the freshness guard no longer treats it as a maintenance command.

## v3.437.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.6 → 0.1.7

#### Fixes

- Skip agent worktrees during Codegraph discovery (SQ-1780)
  Codegraph skips dot-directories such as Claude agent worktrees when discovering Python and TypeScript projects.
- Keep Codegraph from querying empty or failed indexes (SQ-1782)
  Codegraph now reports empty snapshots as missing, and a failed refresh reports the failure for the rest of that session instead of presenting the older snapshot as ready. The older snapshot is kept on disk. A failure is not yet remembered across a restart.
- Fix first-use TypeScript runtime install (SQ-1783)
  Codegraph now installs the pinned platform runtime package during a cold TypeScript runtime acquisition.
- Report project dependency environments (SQ-1784)
  Codegraph now reports configured, conventional, or absent dependency environments for each TypeScript and Python project.
- Silence Pyright index logs (SQ-1791)
  Python indexing no longer writes Pyright configuration and analysis logs to stdout.

### model-gateway 0.48.3 → 0.48.4

#### Fixes

- Rename the Sidequest route marker (SQ-1778)
  Sidequest dispatches now use the `sidequest-route` marker, and Model Gateway accepts only that marker.

### quartermaster 0.1.0 → 0.2.0

#### Features

- Add quartermaster; retire playbook and init-workspace (QM-1)
  quartermaster joins the shed: transcript-mining retros with a decision ledger and outcome verification, plus a history-grounded workspace setup skill that replaces workbench's init-workspace. playbook is retired; its verify-discipline skill moves into sidequest (executor skill pin updated to sidequest:verify-discipline).

### sidequest 4.42.6 → 4.43.0

#### Features

- Add quartermaster; retire playbook and init-workspace (QM-1)
  quartermaster joins the shed: transcript-mining retros with a decision ledger and outcome verification, plus a history-grounded workspace setup skill that replaces workbench's init-workspace. playbook is retired; its verify-discipline skill moves into sidequest (executor skill pin updated to sidequest:verify-discipline).

#### Fixes

- Serialize Sidequest delivery recovery (SQ-1743)
  Prevent concurrent delivery rollbacks from resetting another delivered change, and recover replayed submissions after a target reset.
- Guard Sidequest delivery ownership (SQ-1749)
  Prevent stale delivery locks from releasing a current owner, and refuse patch-id reconciliation when declared content differs.
- Rename the Sidequest route marker (SQ-1778)
  Sidequest dispatches now use the `sidequest-route` marker, and Model Gateway accepts only that marker.
- Ignore unrelated dirty files during Sidequest integration (SQ-1786)
  Sidequest integration now allows dirty files outside the submitted delivery while still refusing files the delivery would overwrite.
- Clarify blocked submission holds (SQ-1790)
  Sidequest now tells orchestrators to record a blocked integration on the ticket instead of attempting an unavailable checkpoint.

### workbench 0.84.0 → 0.85.0

#### Features

- Add quartermaster; retire playbook and init-workspace (QM-1)
  quartermaster joins the shed: transcript-mining retros with a decision ledger and outcome verification, plus a history-grounded workspace setup skill that replaces workbench's init-workspace. playbook is retired; its verify-discipline skill moves into sidequest (executor skill pin updated to sidequest:verify-discipline).

## v3.436.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.5 → 0.1.6

#### Fixes

- Handle unreachable Python code during indexing (SQ-1773)
  Codegraph now keeps indexing Python files when Pyright omits declaration data for unreachable code, recording the affected references as unresolved.
- Avoid duplicate nodes for Python global rebindings (SQ-1774)
  Python global assignments no longer create duplicate graph nodes during indexing.
- Find the pinned Pyright manifest from the shipped plugin build (SQ-1775) [`031a244`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/031a2441)

### sidequest 4.42.5 → 4.42.6

#### Fixes

- Block executor-side ticket dispatch (SQ-1766)
  Executors with an active claim now file and report follow-up tickets instead of dispatching their own subagents.
- Require verification evidence that the changed behavior ran (SQ-1768)

## v3.435.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.4 → 0.1.5

#### Fixes

- Prove Python relationships through Pyright (SQ-1750)
  Use Pyright evaluator results for Python inheritance and ambiguous relationship facts.
- Never report a resolved Python relationship without a target (SQ-1758) [`31b1b88`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/31b1b88)
- Python tests acquire the pinned Pyright runtime (SQ-1761) [`77faeae`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/77faeaed14bba7099cbbaa555d54487ba17cff85)
  Python semantic tests now acquire the pinned runtime instead of depending on a hand-run local install.
- Resolve npm CLI across Node runtime layouts (SQ-1764)
  Pyright runtime acquisition now finds npm from both Windows and Unix Node installations and reports failed install output.
- Make the Pyright runtime tree integrity check portable (SQ-1769) [`0789709`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0789709e)

## v3.434.0 (2026-08-10)

### sidequest 4.42.4 → 4.42.5

#### Fixes

- Preserve readable retained continuation worktrees (SQ-1737)
- Use switchboard route markers (SQ-1738)
  Sidequest dispatches now send the canonical switchboard route marker to model-gateway.
- Retry Windows registry lock contention (SQ-1742)
  Sidequest now retries Windows EPERM registry lock contention while writing installed plugin state.

## v3.433.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.3 → 0.1.4

#### Fixes

- Add pluggable Codegraph language providers (SQ-1727)
  Codegraph now composes language providers through a deterministic registry while preserving TypeScript and JavaScript indexing.
- Add Python project discovery (SQ-1728)
  Codegraph finds Python source trees, Pyright configuration, and relevant freshness inputs.
- Pin the Pyright semantic runtime (SQ-1729)
  Codegraph acquires and verifies a pinned Pyright runtime behind an isolated compatibility adapter.

### sidequest 4.42.3 → 4.42.4

#### Fixes

- Stop continuation worktree double-isolation (SQ-1735)
  Retained Sidequest worktree continuations now start without a conflicting native Agent worktree.

## v3.432.0 (2026-08-10)

### codegraph 0.1.2 → 0.1.3

#### Fixes

- Exclude top-level loop variables from Codegraph (SQ-1725)
- Resolve overlapping Codegraph project ownership (SQ-1726)

### codegraph 0.1.1 → 0.1.2

#### Fixes

- Make Codegraph index real projects (SQ-1724)

## v3.430.0 (2026-08-10)

### codebase-mapper 2.14.3 → 2.14.4

#### Fixes

- Fix Codebase Mapper Stop concurrency test cleanup (SQ-1721) [`ab64edf`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ab64edf6901a3641e8bc9b4151746591f5ac543c)
  Make the overlapping Stop test clean up its lock generation deterministically.

### codegraph 0.1.0 → 0.1.1

#### Fixes

- Fix Codegraph indexing through an aliased project root (SQ-1723)
  Resolve junctions, symlinks, and Windows 8.3 short names before comparing a project root against the paths TypeScript reports, so indexing and freshness work when a project is reached through an alias of its real directory.

## v3.429.0 (2026-08-10)

### codebase-mapper 2.14.2 → 2.14.3

#### Fixes

- Stop hooks bound cascading continuations (SQ-1645)
  Atomically deduplicate each unchanged Stop responsibility across overlapping hook processes, clean stale locks by exact generation without deleting live replacements, keep one map-update batch independent of optional prompt and transcript host metadata, match update-skill completion by session when Stop and PreToolUse prompt IDs differ, distinguish reopened Sidequest claims, rely on Claude's batched Stop protocol for one continuation per hook batch, reset prompt-less map warnings after their responsibility ends, and keep passive re-entry flushes silent while preserving pending-work and map-update gates.

### codegraph 0.0.0 → 0.1.0

#### Features

- Publish Codegraph semantic graph plugin (SQ-1692)
  Publish Codegraph for local TypeScript and JavaScript semantic graph indexing through seven MCP tools.

### observability 0.7.1 → 0.7.2

#### Fixes

- Stop hooks bound cascading continuations (SQ-1645)
  Atomically deduplicate each unchanged Stop responsibility across overlapping hook processes, clean stale locks by exact generation without deleting live replacements, keep one map-update batch independent of optional prompt and transcript host metadata, match update-skill completion by session when Stop and PreToolUse prompt IDs differ, distinguish reopened Sidequest claims, rely on Claude's batched Stop protocol for one continuation per hook batch, reset prompt-less map warnings after their responsibility ends, and keep passive re-entry flushes silent while preserving pending-work and map-update gates.

### sidequest 4.42.2 → 4.42.3

#### Fixes

- Stop reminders for released session tickets (SQ-1636)
- Greenfield integration skips locked dependency setup (SQ-1639)
  Run npm ci before a resolved package suite during integration.
- Stop hooks bound cascading continuations (SQ-1645)
  Atomically deduplicate each unchanged Stop responsibility across overlapping hook processes, clean stale locks by exact generation without deleting live replacements, keep one map-update batch independent of optional prompt and transcript host metadata, match update-skill completion by session when Stop and PreToolUse prompt IDs differ, distinguish reopened Sidequest claims, rely on Claude's batched Stop protocol for one continuation per hook batch, reset prompt-less map warnings after their responsibility ends, and keep passive re-entry flushes silent while preserving pending-work and map-update gates.
- Keep frozen contract page cursors bound to their handles (SQ-1651)
  Keep paginated frozen-contract retrievals on the handle and revision that produced them.
- Reclaim terminated executor claims immediately (SQ-1654)
  Terminal executor failures now immediately release the matching claim or pre-claim dispatch binding, while stale or incomplete runtime evidence stays protected.
- Keep Sidequest test registry writes atomic on Windows (SQ-1662)
- Keep rejected submission history recoverable (SQ-1667)
  Sidequest now validates CLI and MCP submissions through the same checks, preserves rejection records across interrupted writes, and requires repair executors to fetch the complete ordered rejection history.
- Keep live executors and friendly route labels (SQ-1671)

### workbench 0.83.4 → 0.84.0

#### Features

- Pull-only TypeScript code intelligence replaces the native LSP plugin (SQ-1647)
  New local `code-intel` MCP server: definition, references, and diagnostics pulled from the
  project's own TypeScript (native TS 7 LSP, or typescript-language-server for TS 5), bound
  per request to an explicit project root. Push diagnostics are discarded, a location is returned only when
  its native realpath (symlinks and junctions resolved) is an existing file inside the bound
  root (non-file URIs and missing targets are withheld and counted), cancelled calls stop
  their language-server work, and every response is size-bounded, so parallel isolated
  agents only ever receive results they asked for. A frame the server cannot answer honestly is
  refused inside those same bounds: a JSON-RPC id that would not come back as the same value, or a
  request line past the message limit, gets a small `-32600` error and never reaches a language server.

#### Fixes

- Fix code-intel teardown pipe errors (SQ-1719)
  Prevent code-intel shutdown races from leaving unhandled closed-pipe errors after requests end.

## v3.428.0 (2026-08-09)

### sidequest 4.42.1 → 4.42.2

#### Fixes

- Allow greenfield package verify commands (SQ-1635)

## v3.427.0 (2026-08-09)

### codebase-mapper 2.14.1 → 2.14.2

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Codebase Mapper and Playbook docs (SQ-1611)
  Rewrote the Codebase Mapper, Playbook, and experiment-loop guides around user outcomes, with concise plugin READMEs and symptom-based recovery steps.

### live-rules 2.10.1 → 2.10.2

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Workbench and Live-rules user docs (SQ-1610)
  Rewrote the Workbench and Live Rules setup guides and plugin READMEs around the current user flow: install the plugin, ask Claude to set up or manage it, and recover from common failures without running internal commands.

### model-gateway 0.48.2 → 0.48.3

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Model Gateway user docs (SQ-1603)
  Rewrote the Model Gateway setup guide and plugin README around the real user flow: install the plugin, ask Claude to set it up or repair it, and choose a model. Internal commands stay in the agent-facing reference.

### observability 0.7.0 → 0.7.1

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Observability user docs (SQ-1612)
  Rewrote the Observability guides and plugin README around installing the plugin, opting repositories in, reading the local dashboard, and recovering from empty or unavailable views. Added links to the committed synthetic dashboard captures without exposing internal setup details or real telemetry.

### playbook 0.4.1 → 0.4.2

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Codebase Mapper and Playbook docs (SQ-1611)
  Rewrote the Codebase Mapper, Playbook, and experiment-loop guides around user outcomes, with concise plugin READMEs and symptom-based recovery steps.

### sidequest 4.42.0 → 4.42.1

#### Fixes

- Suppress impossible readonly planning warnings (SQ-1600)
  Suppress generated-output and consumer-scope warnings for readonly tickets, and resolve submission-review anchors against their pinned ref or commit.
- Consolidate Sidequest Stop hooks (SQ-1601)
  Combine Sidequest's Stop policies into one handler, so each stop reads its payload once and emits at most one reminder.
- Repair end-to-end context budget benchmark (SQ-1602)
- Run every Luna route at high effort (SQ-1605)
  All Luna starter-profile routes now use high effort.
- Remove briefing and admin ceremony (SQ-1607)
  Executor briefings and spawn orientation now include frozen contracts and ticket inputs without raw story-log history. Sidequest guidance also keeps board-only admin changes out of ticket dispatch.
- Rewrite Sidequest user docs (SQ-1613)
  Rewrote the Sidequest getting-started guide and plugin README around installing Sidequest, planning work with Claude, using the local board, dispatching and integrating tickets, and recovering from common symptoms. Added the committed synthetic board and ticket-detail captures with descriptive captions.
- Route context budget benchmark through MCP paging (SQ-1614)
  Route the context budget benchmark through the production MCP context_page handler and verify its payload ceiling.
- Cut small-ticket executor latency (SQ-1619)
  Remove three optional executor board round trips while keeping stale-worktree protection, final verification evidence, scoped submission, and orchestrator-owned integration.
- Repair final public docs audit findings (SQ-1620)
  Fixed broken generated-reference links, qualified Observability's local-storage wording, corrected Sidequest marketplace capabilities, and added coverage for reference links and scoped skills.
- Scale Sidequest test budget to CI cores (SQ-1621)
  Scale the Sidequest full-suite hang budget with test concurrency so low-core CI runners keep enough time to finish while retaining bounded timeout detection and near-budget warnings.
- Prevent stale dispatch retries clearing fresh tokens (SQ-1622)
  Sidequest now waits for a launched executor to reach a terminal state before retrying dispatch, so an older attempt cannot clear a newer token.

### workbench 0.83.3 → 0.83.4

#### Fixes

- Rewrite Workbench and Live-rules user docs (SQ-1610)
  Rewrote the Workbench and Live Rules setup guides and plugin READMEs around the current user flow: install the plugin, ask Claude to set up or manage it, and recover from common failures without running internal commands.

## v3.426.0 (2026-08-09)

### sidequest 4.41.7 → 4.42.0

#### Features

- Add bounded story contract projections (SQ-1561)
- Bound Sidequest dynamic hook context (SQ-1564)
  Sidequest hook context now stays within explicit, deterministic budgets and sends compact recovery pointers instead of repeating board history.
- Add universal MCP context continuations (SQ-1575)

#### Fixes

- Bound executor briefing context (SQ-1562)
  Executor briefings now use one bounded context projection and point executors to omitted contract pages.
- Keep nested task labels (SQ-1567)
  Nested Sidequest Agent tasks now keep their human dispatch descriptions in FleetView.
- Validate attestation ticket fields (SQ-1568)
  Sidequest now describes and validates its coupled attestation verification fields.
- Normalize planning warning checks (SQ-1569)
  Planning warnings now understand directory globs, explicit readonly choices, punctuated anchors, and npm prefix verify commands.
- Document the native diagnostic boundary (SQ-1572)
  Sidequest now documents that Claude Code's native language-server pipeline can inject diagnostics from live and deleted foreign worktrees before project hooks run, including the measured upstream reproduction and required filter behavior.
- Keep terminal board state authoritative (SQ-1573)
  Completed work no longer gets retried after a contradictory task notification.
- Preserve derived release scope through submission (SQ-1576)
  Keep prepared release-fragment scope through continuation, commit, submission, and integration.
- Bind frozen contract retrieval (SQ-1577)
  Oversized executor contracts now page from the dispatch snapshot even after the live story changes.
- Preserve bounded hook recovery context (SQ-1580)
  Sidequest hook notices now avoid duplicate injected text, preserve worktree redispatch actions, and keep live claims first during compaction recovery.
- Fix universal continuation audit blockers (SQ-1581)
- Close repaired submissions with lineage proof (SQ-1584)
- Compose readonly dispatch with frozen briefings (SQ-1589)
  Zero-scope read-only dispatches use the bound shared checkout, and executor briefings retain their bounded frozen projection.
- Stop reconciliation reminders from creating reply loops (SQ-1590)
- Fix CI git config and Node 20 action warnings (SQ-1592)
  CI now provides each test job an empty writable git config before checkout and uses Node 24 action runtimes.
- Repair bounded Sidequest MCP model and category reads (SQ-1593)
  Bounded MCP model and category reads keep compatible details and context-page retrievals.
- Repair retained-worktree continuation on current main (SQ-1595)
- Upgrade the remaining Node 20 cache action (SQ-1596)
  The test workflow now uses the Node 24 `actions/cache@v5` runtime for its OpenTelemetry cache.
- Allow reviewed retirement in submission supersession (SQ-1597)

## v3.425.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.41.6 → 4.41.7

#### Fixes

- Refuse a submission whose commit is a strict subset of the verified worktree (SQ-822) [`2854cea`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2854cea7)
  Scoped edits left unstaged were swept away with the worktree, so submit now refuses rather than accepting a partial commit.
- Prove the negative control exercised the new test (SQ-1386) [`54e7af3`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/54e7af34)
  A passing negative control only showed that some test caught the revert, not that the new one did, so a test that cannot fail could still ship.
- Warn when loaded plugin code is stale (SQ-1539)
  Warn before dispatching when Sidequest code loaded in the session is older than this project's installed plugin version.
- Accept an agent worktree under either isolation root (SQ-1546) [`ad4fa2a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ad4fa2a9)
  The isolation guard compared an executor's real linked worktree against a path built from sidequest's own worktree root, so a worktree provisioned by Claude Code's isolation:worktree never matched and every write was denied once the agent id was bound.

### workbench 0.83.2 → 0.83.3

#### Fixes

- Warn when loaded plugin code is stale (SQ-1539)
  Warn before dispatching when Sidequest code loaded in the session is older than this project's installed plugin version.

## v3.424.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.41.5 → 4.41.6

#### Fixes

- Leave room for future Sidequest MCP tool arguments (SQ-936)
  Keep the MCP tool list compact while preserving its useful instructions and argument schemas.
- Report paths that block submission integration (SQ-1541)
  Show conflicted paths when a submission merge or replay fails.
- Warn about transitive in-package consumers together (SQ-1542)
  Show direct and transitive package consumers in one capped planning warning so ticket scope converges in one edit.

## v3.423.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.41.4 → 4.41.5

#### Fixes

- Reject malformed verification commands (SQ-1227)
  Reject malformed verify values before submission or integration, and show executors the cmd.exe verify contract.
- Recognize Git Bash repository paths in the destructive Git guard (SQ-1459)
  Allow a held publish lock to authorize manual tag cleanup when Git Bash reports the repository as `/c/...`.
- Clarify foreign-worktree diagnostic guidance (SQ-1464)
  Clarify when diagnostics from foreign agent worktrees are stale noise and when they are actionable before integration.
- Provision isolated worktree dependencies before dispatch (SQ-1471)
  Sidequest now provisions configured dependency directories and setup commands before an isolated executor starts.

## v3.422.0 (2026-08-08)

### observability 0.6.1 → 0.7.0

#### Features

- Add recharge-weighted context accounting (SQ-1516)
  Add completed-session turn, tool-result byte, and recharge-weighted byte panels to the Grafana dashboard.

### sidequest 4.41.3 → 4.41.4

#### Fixes

- Run Sidequest tests at CI-safe concurrency (SQ-1537)
  Run the full Sidequest suite with available CPU parallelism and flag runs that approach the phase timeout.
- Keep verification evidence from blocking closeout (SQ-1538)
  Accept verification status evidence so completed checks and no-op closeouts are recorded.

## v3.421.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.41.2 → 4.41.3

#### Fixes

- Document constrained MCP story log input (SQ-1255)
  Sidequest MCP schemas now document story-log prefixes and byte limits, with an actionable malformed-entry error.
- Preserve verified no-op release provenance (SQ-1529)
  Sidequest records verified no-op releases before isolated worktrees disappear, so they close as no-op work rather than grooming.
- Fix executor spawn instructions (SQ-1533)
  Executor definitions now tell orchestrators to pass the dispatch payload unchanged and let its route marker set the model and effort.

## v3.420.0 (2026-08-08)

### observability 0.6.0 → 0.6.1

#### Fixes

- Requeue exhausted observability deliveries (SQ-1526)
  The observer can requeue exhausted outbox records through its loopback API.

### sidequest 4.41.1 → 4.41.2

#### Fixes

- Move executor worktrees outside project roots (SQ-1425)
  New isolated worktrees live under the per-project Sidequest state root. Existing in-project worktrees remain sweepable while they drain.
- Reap stale Sidequest MCP servers (SQ-1491)
  Sidequest now stops superseded MCP servers from the same Claude process when a replacement starts.
- Validate MCP enum arguments (SQ-1527)
  Sidequest MCP tools now reject invalid enum argument values with the accepted values listed in the error.
- Deduplicate repeated planning warnings (SQ-1528)
  Planning warnings now appear once per ticket in a Claude session, with large warning sets capped and ranked.
- Keep executor scratch files in isolated worktrees (SQ-1530)
  Executor briefings now direct scratch files to the executor's own worktree instead of the shared session scratchpad.
- Make deferred sweep report draining race-safe (SQ-1531)
  Prevent deferred sweep reports from being replayed when a new worker writes a fresh report during session startup.
- Keep stale worktree cwd warnings after worktree relocation (SQ-1532)
  Stale board-server cwd warnings now recognize linked worktrees in the Sidequest state root, legacy project path, or another registered location.

### workbench 0.83.1 → 0.83.2

#### Fixes

- Make CI checks fail closed (SQ-1499)
  Workbench now waits for GitHub Actions runs and reports missing, failed, or inaccessible CI instead of treating silence as green.

## v3.419.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.41.0 → 4.41.1

#### Fixes

- Validate complete verify commands (SQ-1306)
  Verify commands now reject unsafe tails, check each compound step, and cannot be changed to an unrunnable command while work is live.
- Classify unavailable verify commands (SQ-1487)
  Unavailable verify commands now report `could-not-run` instead of a failed test suite.
- Keep Sidequest tests off local services (SQ-1503)
  The full Sidequest suite now uses isolated home, board, and model-discovery state, so tests must provide any local service configuration they need.

## v3.418.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.40.9 → 4.41.0

#### Features

- Add attestation verification oracles (SQ-1500)
  Not every ticket's real oracle is a command. When the board demanded one anyway, executors
  supplied whatever suite happened to pass, and the gate certified work that suite never
  touched.

  A ticket can now declare `verifyKind: attestation` with an `attestationArtifact` naming the
  specific URL, file, frame, or returned count that must be observed. The executor records
  what it actually saw as `attestation: <artifact> | <evidence produced> | <what it showed>`,
  and that becomes the reviewable oracle. Briefings say so explicitly, including that an
  unrelated passing suite is not a substitute.

#### Fixes

- Reject unknown Sidequest MCP arguments (SQ-926)
  Sidequest MCP tools now reject unknown arguments with the accepted keys, and category edits can update or clear routing fallbacks.
- Sync new executor worktrees to local integration main (SQ-1502)
  New isolated executor worktrees now synchronize to integrated local main commits before work starts.

## v3.417.0 (2026-08-08)

### observability 0.5.3 → 0.6.0

#### Features

- A stalled observer now reports unhealthy and steps aside (SQ-1524)
  An observer left over from a deleted worktree held the observer port for nine hours while
  delivering nothing, and answered `ok: true` the whole time. Its outbox had stopped
  retrying, and a `TypeError` in our own transport had counted against the retry budget as
  though the remote had rejected the batch.

  `/health` now returns 503 with `outbox_stalled` when records are pending and delivery
  attempts have stopped advancing, and with `plugin_version_outdated` when the running
  observer is older than the installed plugin. An outdated observer retires itself and frees
  the port instead of squatting on it. A transport-side `TypeError` no longer consumes a
  retry attempt, since it says nothing about whether the sink would have accepted the batch.

#### Fixes

- Collapse the spend query from 48 legs to 4 (SQ-1521)
  The Grafana spend panels priced tokens with one LogQL leg per (model, token type): 48
  `sum_over_time` legs sharing one unnarrowed selector, joined into a 12.7KB expression.
  Loki reread the whole stream once per leg, measured at 229MB and 433k lines to return a
  single number from a window holding about 5,500 entries. An open dashboard tab was worth
  roughly 8 cores.

  Prices now travel as a label, so one leg per token type covers every model. Same window,
  same cost figure (matching to 8.9e-16), 18MB read instead of 229MB.
- Stop a cosmetic probe from taking telemetry down (SQ-1525)
  `setup-observability` asked Prometheus which projects were recently active without
  supplying a start time, so the request sent `start=undefined` and Prometheus answered 400.
  That threw after the managed processes had already been stopped, leaving nothing listening
  on the observer port: a run meant to repair telemetry took it from degraded to fully down.

  The activity window now defaults to the last 30 days and rejects a non-timestamp instead
  of interpolating it into the query. Which per-project dashboards to provision is cosmetic,
  so a failed probe now degrades to the global dashboard and says so on stderr rather than
  aborting the run.

## v3.416.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.40.8 → 4.40.9

#### Fixes

- Read comment updates incrementally (SQ-1515)
  `comments` can now return only entries added after a prior comment id or timestamp.
- Restore executor tools (SQ-1523)
  Executor definitions no longer emit a `tools:` allow-list. Since 4.40.6 every executor
  carried `tools: default, Skill(playbook:verify-discipline)`, and `default` is a CLI
  sentinel rather than a frontmatter tool name, so executors spawned with no Bash and no
  board tools and could not fetch their briefing. Skill preloading stays pinned by `skills:`.

## v3.415.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.40.7 → 4.40.8

#### Fixes

- Compact successful integration verification results (SQ-1514)
- Recover terminal executor claims without redispatching (SQ-1518)
- Warn when ticket file scope omits likely module consumers (SQ-1519)

## v3.414.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.40.6 → 4.40.7

#### Fixes

- Bind a dispatch to its executor from the claim token (SQ-1413)
  An isolated dispatch used to bind only when Claude Code's spawn interception could match the launch to a running agent. Concurrent spawns made that match ambiguous and resumed agents never passed through it at all, so the claim was refused as `unbound_dispatch` and the executor died having done nothing. Presenting the prepared dispatch's briefing token at claim now binds the claiming identity directly.
- Let the declared verify pass before the generated outputs are committed (SQ-1512)
  `build:check` used to fail on any uncommitted file under `bin`, `lib` or `hooks`, so an executor that edited TypeScript and then ran its declared verify was refused for outputs it had just regenerated correctly. There was no ordering of edit, verify and submit that passed. It now fails only on outputs the build itself changed, which still catches stale committed output in CI while letting correct work through mid-change.
- Report every independent completion refusal together (SQ-1513)
  Submit, add, and integrate now report all independently fixable validation failures in one response.

## v3.413.0 (2026-08-08)

### sidequest 4.40.5 → 4.40.6

#### Fixes

- Carry released executor checkpoints into continuation dispatches (SQ-1462)
- Preserve oracle verdict rounds when an executor asks for a ruling (SQ-1483)
- Bound executor skill loading (SQ-1495) [`df7ac03`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/df7ac0352287d26cc6366234ace5eb9c42f9c651)
- Explain rejected import-error negative controls (SQ-1498) [`0ee811d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0ee811dbd1827c2c22447ea7837e480d09b20429)
- Rule on scope requests immediately instead of pausing the executor (SQ-1504)
  Scope requests now rule immediately. Policy-allowed paths expand scope, while refused paths are handed back for orchestrator redispatch. Executors no longer wait on a pending ruling that may never arrive.
- Preserve continuation checkpoints on Windows short paths (SQ-1509)
  Continuation dispatches now keep committed handbacks when Windows path aliases resolve to the same repository.

## v3.412.0 (2026-08-07)

### observability 0.5.2 → 0.5.3

#### Fixes

- Unify dashboard spend across model backends (SQ-1501)
  Grafana now reports one reconciled spend total with unified model and project breakdowns across every backend. Project views include gateway-attributed spend, and the Codex routing stat no longer shows Grafana's query-reference label.

## v3.411.0 (2026-08-07)

### model-gateway 0.48.1 → 0.48.2

#### Fixes

- Gateway usage records now include their session project (SQ-1488)
  Gateway token-usage records now resolve their Claude Code session to a project
  and send that project as an OTLP resource attribute, so Codex spend appears in
  per-project dashboards.

### observability 0.5.1 → 0.5.2

#### Fixes

- Simplify Grafana dashboards and rebuild them from active telemetry (SQ-1492)
  Grafana dashboards now focus on cost, routing, failures, and source health with 15 mostly graphical panels instead of 39. Project dashboards rebuild from recent telemetry rather than the opt-in registry, and `setup-observability --reset-dashboards` clears generated dashboards until fresh activity returns.

### sidequest 4.40.4 → 4.40.5

#### Fixes

- Reserve executor verification budget (SQ-1400)
  Briefings tell executors to run declared verification early, plan around the observed tool-call cap, and report when verification was not reached.
- Refuse unscoped write dispatches (SQ-1485)
  Dispatch now refuses write tickets without declared file scope unless the caller explicitly overrides it.
- Wait for SQLite database contention (SQ-1493)
  Sidequest now waits through brief SQLite lock contention and reports an actionable error if the wait expires.
- Enforce Codex dispatch route markers (SQ-1494) [`ef2019d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ef2019d5742c7a72262a18ff4cbdd9a55e28821b)
  Sidequest now refuses a prepared Codex dispatch when its route marker is missing or a Claude executor class would run it on the wrong backend.
- Fix Windows verification capture timeouts and quoted paths (SQ-1496)
  Verification now stops timed-out Windows command trees and preserves quoted command paths.

## v3.410.0 (2026-08-07)

### observability 0.5.0 → 0.5.1

#### Fixes

- Recover stale observability observer ports (SQ-1479)
  Observability now replaces stale or unresponsive observer processes during upgrades and shows the owner details at session start.
- Keep Grafana telemetry flowing when the local observer stalls (SQ-1480)
  Collector sink pipelines now isolate local observer failures, and the model token panel also reads direct gateway telemetry.
- Prune observability storage automatically (SQ-1481)
  The observer now prunes expired telemetry on a schedule, checkpoints oversized WAL files, reports storage limits, and rotates managed logs.

### sidequest 4.40.3 → 4.40.4

#### Fixes

- Refuse executor self-dispatches and show unbound launches as stalled (SQ-1416)
  Executors now get an actionable release path when a dispatch is unbound, and the board shows launches that cannot be claimed as stalled.
- Keep claims held when dispatch.boundAt is null and reclaim missing worktrees (SQ-1450)
- Warn when worktree fixtures differ from integration (SQ-1454)
- Accept annotated negative-control evidence (SQ-1465)
  Negative-control markers now accept trailing context and explain malformed marker lines.
- Retry failed worktree quarantines after a daily delay (SQ-1466)
- Record oracle verdicts when the experiment round is missing (SQ-1467)
  Oracle verdicts now create their missing experiment-log round instead of leaving the ticket unable to resolve the ask.
- Let executor sessions compact under the veto policy (SQ-1468)
  Executor sessions no longer block automatic compaction while they hold their own Sidequest claim.
- Remove executor turn cap (SQ-1469)
  Sidequest executor definitions no longer impose a turn cap, preventing completed work from being terminated before it can be committed or handed back.
- Tell executors to regenerate paired outputs before verify (SQ-1472)
  Executor briefings now tell users to regenerate auto-paired tracked generated files before verifying.
- Stop treating slashed prose as anchor paths (SQ-1477)
  Anchor warnings now ignore slash-containing prose and resolve package-relative files.

## v3.409.0 (2026-08-07)

### live-rules 2.10.0 → 2.10.1

#### Fixes

- Scoped rules keep working when Windows hands us two spellings of the same path (SQ-1444)
  Windows can name one directory more than one way: a short 8.3 form like
  `C:\Users\RUNNER~1`, a different drive-letter case, a substituted drive. Claude
  Code hands the project root and the edited file path to a hook through different
  APIs, and those two can disagree about which spelling they use.

  When they disagreed, the relative path came out looking like it pointed outside
  the project, the hook decided the edit was somewhere else, and every glob- and
  directory-scoped rule quietly did not inject. No warning. Rules looked like they
  had simply never been written.

  Both sides are now resolved to a real canonical path before they are compared,
  so the spelling no longer decides whether your rules apply. Files that do not
  exist yet still work, which matters because edit hooks fire for new files.

### model-gateway 0.48.0 → 0.48.1

#### Fixes

- The secret-hazard check no longer misses in-project files on Windows (SQ-1446)
  Same Windows path-spelling problem as SQ-1444, in three more places.

  Playbook decides whether a written file is inside the project before warning you
  about an untracked sensitive file. When the project root and the file path came
  through with different spellings, a real in-project secret was dropped from the
  hazard report, which is the one thing that check exists to catch.

  Workbench compared installed-plugin and Sidequest install paths the same raw
  way, so project- and local-scoped installs could be reported missing or inactive
  and the freshness hook told you to set up something you already had.

  Model-gateway used a raw path as its project-wiring registry key, so one project
  could be recorded twice and reconciled twice against the same settings file.

  All three now canonicalize both sides before comparing.

### observability 0.4.0 → 0.5.0

#### Features

- The token report can now answer whether cost actually moved (SQ-1418)
  The board cost report had no time window, so it could tell you what executors
  cost in total and never whether that number went up or down after a change.
  `--since`, `--until` and `--compare-previous` now window it, and the comparison
  reports per-category average-token deltas between the two windows.

  The orchestrator/executor split used to label agent-id-absent traffic as the
  orchestrator. That was inference by absence: the gateway derives its role from
  the same header, so an absent agent id means unidentified, not main loop. That
  bucket is now called `orchestrator_or_unidentified` and says what it actually
  knows.

  The text report also printed the whole per-request ledger before any rollup, so
  the summary sat a few thousand lines below the raw data. Rollups come first now
  and the ledger is behind `--ledger`.
- Canonicalize observability project paths (SQ-1445)
  Observability now resolves filesystem aliases before deriving a telemetry `project_id`.
  Telemetry rows written under the old raw-path-derived ID remain in the local store, but
  are not read under the canonical project identity and will no longer appear in that
  project's dashboard. New events use the canonical ID.

### playbook 0.4.0 → 0.4.1

#### Fixes

- The secret-hazard check no longer misses in-project files on Windows (SQ-1446)
  Same Windows path-spelling problem as SQ-1444, in three more places.

  about an untracked sensitive file. When the project root and the file path came

  could be recorded twice and reconciled twice against the same settings file.

  All three now canonicalize both sides before comparing.

### sidequest 4.40.2 → 4.40.3

#### Fixes

- Sidequest warns about diagnostics from other agents' worktrees (SQ-1420)
  Sidequest now warns when diagnostics point at another agent's embedded worktree.
  Those diagnostics can be stale or missing-dependency artifacts, including ones
  shown as errors, and previously flooded agents' context until two executors hit
  "Prompt is too long" before reading their briefings.

  The warning keeps diagnostics in the receiving agent's own checkout actionable
  and marks foreign-worktree diagnostics as non-actionable.
- Plugin submissions now require a release fragment (SQ-1427)
  Sidequest now refuses submissions that change a marketplace plugin without the
  matching release fragment. The refusal says where to create it, what frontmatter
  it needs, and that the executor must request scope for that path first.
- Negative-control submissions keep executor attribution (SQ-1435)
  Sidequest now accepts a real negative control recorded by the active executor instead of refusing the submission as if no control existed. When a control belongs to another executor, the refusal names the attribution mismatch.
- Let executors write their own release fragment (SQ-1440)
  Executors can commit their ticket's own release fragment without requesting scope. This removes the same scope round trip that blocked this fix and left other plugin fragments to be written by hand. Other tickets' fragments remain outside the grant.
- The release-fragment guard now covers both submit paths (SQ-1448)
  SQ-1427 made submit refuse a plugin change with no release fragment, but only
  through the MCP tool. There are two submit paths, and the CLI one, which is what
  inline and admin work uses, still let the change through.

  Both paths enforce it now.

  This matters because a plugin change that lands with no fragment never moves its
  version, and a version that never moves never reaches anyone's install. The work
  looks shipped and is not.
- Salvage old unintegrated Sidequest worktrees before removing them (SQ-1449)
  Sidequest now saves stale unintegrated worktrees to recovery refs before removing them.
- Executor verification resolves its capture script from the installed plugin (SQ-1453)
  Executor verification now uses the installed Sidequest plugin's own capture script path, so it works from projects that do not contain the Toolshed repository layout.
- Raise release suite timeout and allow plugin overrides (SQ-1460)
  Default test-directory suites now allow two minutes per test, so release cuts keep a useful timeout without treating normal filesystem and process I/O as a hung test. A plugin can set `suiteTimeout` in its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` when its suite needs a different limit.
- Integration git commands cannot wait on configured editors forever (SQ-1461)
  Integration git commands now disable configured editors and time out after two minutes, so a hidden editor cannot leave a merge or replay blocked indefinitely.

### workbench 0.83.0 → 0.83.1

#### Fixes

- The secret-hazard check no longer misses in-project files on Windows (SQ-1446)
  Same Windows path-spelling problem as SQ-1444, in three more places.

  Playbook decides whether a written file is inside the project before warning you
  about an untracked sensitive file. When the project root and the file path came
  through with different spellings, a real in-project secret was dropped from the
  hazard report, which is the one thing that check exists to catch.

  Workbench compared installed-plugin and Sidequest install paths the same raw
  way, so project- and local-scoped installs could be reported missing or inactive
  and the freshness hook told you to set up something you already had.

  Model-gateway used a raw path as its project-wiring registry key, so one project
  could be recorded twice and reconciled twice against the same settings file.

  All three now canonicalize both sides before comparing.

## v3.408.0 (2026-08-07)

### observability 0.3.3 → 0.4.0

#### Features

- Telemetry retention, so the observability database stops growing forever (SQ-1423)
  Nothing ever pruned the local telemetry database. On a machine that had been
  running it for a few weeks it had reached 8.7 GB across 13.5M measurement rows,
  and a single grouped scan of the gateway usage rows took 111 seconds, which is
  why the token usage report had become unusable rather than merely slow.

  There is now a prune command with a 30-day default window, a configurable one,
  and indexes for the retention and usage-query filters. It runs in a transaction
  and is safe against a live observer.

  Running it reports what it would remove and how much space that reclaims;
  deleting anything needs `--apply`. It says up front that SQLite does not hand
  space back to the filesystem without `VACUUM`, which needs free space roughly
  equal to the database. `--help` lists every option and marks the destructive
  ones.

### sidequest 4.40.1 → 4.40.2

#### Fixes

- Executor verify no longer reports working code as red on Windows (SQ-1408)
  The wrapper that captures an executor's verify run was built around POSIX shell
  syntax, so on Windows it died with a syntax error before the suite ran. The
  executor read that as its own tests failing and reported a red that was really
  the harness breaking. On SQ-1406 that nearly got finished, working code thrown
  away.

  Verify capture now picks the shell per platform and reads the real exit status
  back from a marker the command itself writes, so a wrapper that cannot run is
  reported as `could-not-run` rather than as a failing suite. A red now means the
  tests failed.
- An executor can always undo its own uncommitted edits (SQ-1419)
  An executor that made a bad edit inside its own declared scope could not undo
  it. The write went through, the revert was refused because the acting agent id
  no longer resolved to an active ticket, and the executor released with the
  damage still sitting in the tree. In a shared checkout that leaves broken
  uncommitted code in the tree a running app builds from, which is how a mistake
  the executor had already caught became something a human had to find.

  Restoring a declared-scope file to its committed content is now always allowed.
  It cannot introduce anything the repository did not already contain, so there is
  nothing for scope enforcement to protect against. Writing new content to an
  unbound or out-of-scope path is refused exactly as before.
- A stale board-server cwd is now warned about under isolated dispatch too (SQ-1421)
  A board server left running from a leftover `.claude/worktrees` directory breaks
  dispatch, and the warning that says so only fired for shared-tree dispatch. That
  is the mode where the consequence is mildest. Under isolated dispatch, the same
  stale cwd made every dispatch fail to bind, and the warning stayed silent
  throughout while someone spent an hour finding it by hand.

  The check now runs for every dispatch, with wording per mode: shared-tree keeps
  its existing message, isolated gets one naming what actually goes wrong there and
  that restarting the session clears it.
- A worktree that cannot be removed is quarantined instead of retried forever (SQ-1422)
  Most executor worktrees remove cleanly. The ones that do not are the ones where
  an executor materialized native build artifacts inside them — a `.venv` with
  compiled extensions, `node_modules` with native addons — because Windows keeps
  handles on loaded binaries, and the processes holding them can outlive anything
  you are able to kill.

  The sweep used to retry those every session, which is why it started exceeding
  its own SessionStart budget. A worktree whose removal fails is now quarantined:
  recorded, moved aside, and never selected as a working directory or retried
  again.

  Stale MCP server processes were looked at as part of this and are not ours to
  reap — `claude.exe` owns their lifecycle.
- The scope-drift warning no longer fires on every dispatch (SQ-1432)
  Any repository with a `docs` directory got a scope-drift warning on every
  dispatch, because `docs/` is granted to every dispatch by policy and is never
  part of what a ticket declares. The two sets could not agree, so the warning
  fired on every pulse and told the reader to resync a scope that was already
  correct. Resyncing did not help either, since the next dispatch re-granted it.

  Always-in-scope paths are now excluded from the comparison, so the warning only
  appears when a dispatch really does enforce something the ticket did not declare
  — and it prints the declared casing, so the difference it names is the real one.

## v3.407.0 (2026-08-07)

### sidequest 4.40.0 → 4.40.1

#### Fixes

- Dispatch stopped binding when a ticket's text mentioned another ticket (SQ-1413)
  4.40.0 started carrying ticket title, description, and anchors in the spawn
  prompt. The Agent gate resolved a spawn's tickets by scanning that whole prompt
  for `SQ-` refs, so any ticket whose own text named another ticket suddenly
  looked like a multi-ticket batch. The gate then denied it as conflicting or
  not-found and recorded no launch, and the executor failed its claim with
  `unbound_dispatch`.

  The gate now takes the dispatched refs from the briefing command, where each ref
  is paired with its own token, and falls back to scanning only when no briefing
  command is present. Ticket prose can name whatever it likes.

## v3.406.0 (2026-08-07)

### sidequest 4.39.1 → 4.40.0

#### Features

- Carry implementation context into executor spawns (SQ-1265)
  Dispatch prompts now spend a bounded 1.2 KB on the ticket title, body excerpt, declared scope, anchors, and newest story finding before the token-gated fetch. Per-section caps keep the serialized spawn below the existing 2 KB ceiling even when one field is huge. The fetched briefing raises the newest-first story log window to 16 KB, enough for one maximum-size 16,000-byte handoff plus metadata. That small upfront packet replaces the 439-byte pointer without reintroducing full board payloads, and targets the measured 63-425 KB rediscovery runs.
- Scope inside a ticket's own package is granted without a ruling (SQ-1384)
  A scope request used to pause the executor and wait for a human ruling no matter
  what it asked for. That round trip is fatal rather than slow: an executor that
  pauses before its first edit has an unchanged worktree, and the runtime sweeps
  it when the process ends. Two of those cost 520,087 tokens for zero output in a
  single session.

  An audit of 2,243 tickets found 30 retained scope resolutions: 25 granted, 2
  partial, 3 denied. The three refusals share real boundaries, and those are what
  the new default is built from. Concrete paths inside the ticket's own package or
  plugin are granted at request time. Another package or plugin, protected control
  and release paths, wildcards, and read-only tickets still pause for a ruling, and
  the scope record still shows what was granted and why.

### workbench 0.82.0 → 0.83.0

#### Features

- The freshness guard checks the remote manifest for every plugin (SQ-1383)
  The prompt freshness guard used to compare two things that could both be stale,
  so it could report everything current while an installed plugin sat behind. It
  now checks the remote manifest for every active Toolshed plugin, through a cache
  so the check does not pay a network round trip on every prompt.

## v3.405.0 (2026-08-07)

### sidequest 4.39.0 → 4.39.1

#### Fixes

- Clarify shared-tree warnings and scoped pulse git fields (SQ-1405)
  Two outputs stated a conclusion without saying what they measured, and both were
  read as bugs by someone who then proposed fixes that would have broken working
  behavior.

  The stale-worktree-cwd warning now says it is about a shared-tree dispatch, that
  the executor has no worktree of its own, and which project root it should be
  running from. It only ever fired for shared-tree dispatches, because an isolated
  executor gets an absolute worktree path pinned in its briefing, but the old text
  said "spawned executors" and read like the gate was backwards.

  `pulse`'s `git.commit` and `git.dirty` are both scoped to the ticket's declared
  files, so the commit is usually older than HEAD and the dirty flag is not
  repository-wide. Both now carry a note field saying so.
- Recover unbound Sidequest dispatch claims (SQ-1406)
  Pulse now identifies claimed dispatches that never recorded a runtime identity.
  Those claims use the inactivity backstop instead of staying claimed forever.

## v3.404.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.38.0 → 4.39.0

#### Features

- The feature skill is now the user-story skill (SQ-1402)
  `/sidequest:feature` is now `/sidequest:user-story`. The skill files a story and
  its backlog, and it drives more than features: subsystems, redesigns, refactors,
  multi-part bug work. Naming it after what it produces matches the board's own
  `US-n` vocabulary. The old name is gone, with no alias.

## v3.403.0 (2026-08-06)

### codebase-mapper 2.14.0 → 2.14.1

#### Fixes

- Delete tests that pinned wording instead of behavior (SQ-1238)
  715 assertions across four plugins checked that documentation said something in
  one particular arrangement of words. They failed when a paragraph was rewrapped
  and passed when a claim was reworded away, so they cost suite time and release
  diagnoses without protecting anything. They are gone.

  17 assertions survive, and each guards something a user or caller actually
  depends on: a banned instruction that must never reappear, a threshold on a real
  cost, a contract a descriptor has to convey. Those now assert the mechanism
  rather than the sentence, matching whitespace-tolerantly where only text can
  express the claim.

  The worst habit this removes is not the wasted time. It is that shipped prose was
  being edited to satisfy a regex, which lets a test quietly start writing the
  documentation.

### observability 0.3.2 → 0.3.3

### sidequest 4.37.0 → 4.38.0

#### Features

- Run one ticket on a different model without touching its category (SQ-1390)
  A ticket can now carry its own route override, so "run this one on a stronger
  model" no longer means editing the category route and silently repointing every
  later ticket that shares it. Set it through `add` or `update` on the MCP tool or
  the CLI; dispatch prefers it over the category route.

  The override goes through the same checks the category route already gets. It
  cannot cross providers, and an override naming a model that is not currently
  available refuses the dispatch rather than quietly falling back to a weaker one,
  because a silent downgrade defeats the reason for naming a model.

  The spawn-gate refusal now names the ticket's resolved route and points at the
  override, instead of only stating that the marker did not match.
- Work in your own repo while an executor integrates (SQ-1392)
  Integration used to refuse whenever the working tree was dirty, including files
  that had nothing to do with the ticket. Editing your own notes or settings while
  an agent worked would block it, and the agent's only way forward was to touch
  files it had correctly been told to leave alone.

  Integration now blocks only on dirty paths inside the ticket's declared scope or
  its submitted range. Everything else is reported as one informational line and
  left exactly as it is.

  Rollback got safer in the same pass. Both the post-verification path and the
  replay-conflict path now roll back with `--merge`, which refuses when it would
  overwrite a local edit, instead of a tree-wide hard reset that would delete it.
  A refused rollback is reported rather than silently swallowed.

- Messaging a finished executor is refused before it wakes up (SQ-1391)
  Submitting is terminal: it releases the claim, and the executor that produced
  the work can no longer amend it. Asking it anyway used to wake the executor,
  spend a turn on it, and get the same answer the board already knew, before the
  idle hook shut it down.

  That message is now refused up front, and the refusal names the supported paths:
  file a follow-up ticket, or redispatch a ticket that was released without a
  pending submission. Executors that are still working are unaffected.

  The claim lifecycle is stated directly in the orchestrator guidance, because the
  tempting move is to reach for the executor that already has the context.

## v3.402.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.36.0 → 4.37.0

#### Features

- The test suite runs in half the time, with nothing removed (SQ-1387)
  Two things were making every run slower than it needed to be, and neither was the number of tests.

  A hook latency benchmark sat inside the default suite costing 23.6 seconds, 12.7% of the total. An audit proved it could not do its job: injecting a 100ms delay into session-start raised the reported median from 244ms to 434ms and the test still passed. It has no threshold to fail. It now lives behind `npm run test:perf`, and the coverage it was genuinely providing, that every hook runs without crashing, moved to a smoke test that reads the hook list from `hooks.json` instead of a hardcoded set, so a new hook is covered the moment it is configured.

  The runner was pinned to 4-way concurrency on a machine with 32 cores. Measured across the whole suite: 106s at 4, 77s at 8, 83s at 12, 88s at 16. It gets worse past 8, because the heaviest files spawn git subprocesses and build real worktrees that then contend on the same disk. The setting is now derived from available cores with that cap, so a small CI runner gets a small number.

  Full gate wall clock: about 190 seconds down to 102.

  Separately, the MCP descriptor golden compared serialized bytes, which meant a diff on it told a reviewer only that something moved. Reversing the descriptor order was enough to fail it, and that changes no contract. It now asserts what callers actually depend on: removed tools stay absent, names stay unique, and the descriptions and schema properties that carry caller discipline still say what they need to say.

## v3.401.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.35.0 → 4.36.0

#### Features

- Executors verify what they changed; the integrator runs the full suite (SQ-1381)
  Every executor was running the whole plugin suite before submitting, inside its own budget, in a worktree forked from `origin/main` when it was dispatched. The result could not be trusted: five executors in one session forked the same commit and four merges landed while they worked, so each one's "full suite passed" described a tree that no longer existed. The orchestrator re-ran the same suite on the merged tree anyway, and that is the run every decision was actually made on.

  So the suite was being paid for twice, and the copy nobody could believe was the expensive one. Worse, it was the last thing every run did, which made it exactly where a run died when it ran out of budget: one executor was stopped partway through its gate after 319,915 tokens.

  Executors now verify the surface they changed and submit. A submission whose verify command does not match the one the ticket declared is refused, so the scoped run cannot quietly become something else. The full suite runs once, on the merged tree, where it is the only place it means anything.
- Ticket authoring: establish the premise, and ask for behavior instead of a test count (SQ-1382)
  Two authoring rules, from watching the same mistake in two costumes: asserting instead of establishing, with the executor paying for it.

  An orchestrator filed a fix whose premise was a number it had never measured. Two executors in a row released with `contradiction`, each having done the work to show the premise was false. The measurement, run afterward, found the effect had the opposite shape. A claim a fix depends on now needs the command, its output, and where it ran, or a link to the read-only ticket that established it. Unmeasured means file the measurement first. A warning fires at add and at dispatch, and stays quiet when the evidence is cited or linked.

  The second rule is about coverage. Asking for "one test per fix" asks for a count, and a count is trivially satisfied by a golden that asserts bytes did not move. Tickets now state the behavior that must keep working, the input that would expose a break, and what a useful failure should identify. As many assertions as the contract needs, and no ceremony.

## v3.400.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.34.0 → 4.35.0

#### Features

- The repeat-dispatch breaker stops counting correct pauses as failures (SQ-1340)
  Dispatching a ticket a third time was blocked with a diagnosis the board had never established: "Environment visibility is the leading hypothesis." It said that on every no-commit repeat, regardless of what the prior attempts actually were.

  The cause was one layer below the message. Release validation checked the kind and then dropped it: `scope_pause` and `handback` were accepted, confirmed valid, and returned as an empty result, so they never reached the attempt record. The breaker had nothing to discriminate on, so it counted every terminal attempt with no commit as a failure. A scope pause is the board working as designed, and it was accumulating toward a block.

  The validated kind now travels with the release, onto the terminal attempt, along with its reason and evidence. Scope pauses and handbacks no longer count toward the breaker at all. When it does block, it names the recorded attempts and their causes instead of asserting one hypothesis, and it only claims a worktree-shaped failure when the attempts carry that shape.

  Found the hard way: this ticket was blocked from dispatching by its own breaker, with the exact wrong diagnosis it exists to remove.
- Wrong anchors are caught when written, not when an executor hits them (SQ-1371)
  An anchor that points at a file or symbol that does not exist was only discovered by the executor, after it had already paid for a worktree, a briefing, and the reading it took to find out. The ticket looked fine on the board the whole time.

  Anchors are now checked at write time, so a bad one surfaces to whoever is filing the ticket while it is still cheap to fix. Executors are also told plainly that an anchor they find wrong can be corrected rather than treated as gospel or worked around.
- A scope pause no longer destroys the worktree it paused in (SQ-1377)
  An isolated worktree is removed when its agent finishes without changing anything. An executor that asks for scope before its first edit and then ends looks exactly like that, so the whole run is swept: one measured case cost 246,657 tokens for zero output, and the scope grant landed seconds after the executor gave up.

  There is no cheap recovery once the process ends. A held claim makes it look like the work survived, and it has not. So the fix has to land before the pause, not after it: requesting scope from a clean isolated worktree now writes an empty marker commit first, which is enough to stop it reading as untouched.

  The tests here cover our side, that the marker is written and the retention recorded. Whether the runtime sweeper spares a worktree whose only change is an empty commit is not something a test in this repo can observe. Every worktree carrying a real commit has survived so far, which is the evidence this rests on.
- Test assertions that measured the wrong thing become measurements (SQ-1380)
  Three assertions were shaping the code around numbers nobody had chosen deliberately.

  The MCP `tools/list` payload had a 17,500-byte ceiling written as a literal in our own test, and the payload was sitting 17,492 bytes: eight bytes of headroom. Two executors were told that ceiling was a real protocol constraint and spent effort contorting schemas to fit under it. It is now a reported measurement against a recorded baseline, so a size change is visible without being a failure.

  The CLI goldens compared a byte count and a sha256. A diff on those tells a reviewer nothing except that something moved, so the only available response was to regenerate them. They now assert the substrings the output must contain, which is the thing anyone actually cared about, and stay strict where the old golden was strict: an error case still has to print nothing to stdout.

  The hook latency test gated on absolute wall-clock ceilings, which cannot mean anything on a hosted runner shared with other work. It reports its numbers now. A hook that crashes still fails the test, because every sample asserts its exit status.

#### Fixes

- Regressions for the board API papercuts that had no coverage (SQ-1378)
  The four remaining papercuts from the earlier API pass turned out to be already fixed, with nothing asserting them. They have regressions now: MCP rejecting unknown parameters instead of silently ignoring them, `list` returning `verify` while keeping `executorVerify` for older callers, and `profile get` working as a CLI action with unknown actions failing loudly.

## v3.399.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.33.0 → 4.34.0

#### Features

- Board API errors name the call that would have worked (SQ-1336)
  A batch of small API defects, each measured costing real retries across three consumer boards.

  `link` wanted `{from, verb, to}` and refused every natural guess with a bare `bad_type` that named neither the valid verbs nor the expected shape: 14 consecutive failures in ten seconds on one board, eleven more across four days on another, twice abandoned for the CLI. The MCP path now names the verbs and the parameter shape, the way the CLI already did. Inverting a dependency no longer requires removing both directions first; `link` replaces an existing opposite-direction edge.

  `groomClose`, `release`, and `done` revealed their requirements one refusal at a time, turning ten closures into roughly 25 tool calls. A refusal now lists every determinable missing parameter and flag at once.

  There was no way to read a single ticket, so an orchestrator piped whole-board JSON through filters 37 times. `sidequest show <ref>` returns one ticket in full.

  Story-log entries were refused past 280 bytes by a storage-side cap, while a separate cap already bounded what reaches an executor prompt; 22 refusals were observed. Storage is now generous and the briefing cap does the bounding, matching how comments already work. `--rotate` also refused the very `--by orchestrator` its own test passed, because the guard read a resolved default instead of the parsed option.

## v3.398.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.32.0 → 4.33.0

#### Features

- Scope a new source file implies is granted without a round trip (SQ-1341)
  Scope-expansion round trips stalled executors on 17 distinct tickets across two boards in a week, and the overwhelmingly common request was for a file the work already in scope mechanically requires. A round trip is not cheap: an executor that pauses before its first edit loses its worktree when its process ends, so the whole run is unrecoverable. One measured 163k tokens for zero output.

  The recurring case: an executor extracts code into a new source file that IS in scope, then stalls because a new file cannot build without its build-registration entry. On Terge_VST that was `CMakeLists.txt`, and it cost two of one ticket's four attempts. That is not a judgement call and it is not scope creep.

  A scope request for the build-registration file governing a directory already in scope is now granted automatically, with a comment attributing the grant to the derived rule. The governing file is found by walking up from the in-scope source: `go.mod` for Go, `Cargo.toml` for Rust, `CMakeLists.txt` otherwise, plus barrel and re-export files. Only the single file the walk finds is granted, never a pattern, and if no governing file is found the request stays pending for a human.

  This is derived from the repository rather than configured, on purpose. The mechanism for turning knobs like this on has existed for weeks and the boards that needed it never got it, so a rule that requires a maintainer to pre-declare `CMakeLists.txt` would not have helped anyone.

  Boards can additionally opt into `autoApproveScope` glob patterns for cases that are not derivable, with mixed requests split so matching paths are granted and the rest stay pending. A repeat request identical to the current pending one returns that request with its age instead of firing again.

## v3.397.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.31.0 → 4.32.0

#### Features

- A parked ticket cannot be restarted by a dispatch nobody made (SQ-1333)
  A ticket on another board was parked deliberately: status todo, no claim, dispatch released. A fifth dispatch was then prepared and claimed 23 seconds later with `agentId: null` and `boundAt: null`, with no orchestrator involved. The session's own account of it: "I didn't launch it. So the break I described didn't actually hold, and that's on the board's behavior, not something I chose."

  The forensics ruled out the obvious suspects rather than guessing. Sweeps only expire and release, and the recovery path was `recovery: null`, so neither prepared it. The transcript carries no dispatch tool use anywhere in the surrounding fifteen minutes while the record carries that session id. What remains is an un-attributed dispatch invocation followed by a claim accepted before any runtime identity existed to bind it to.

  Dispatch records now carry `preparedBy`: which session, and which surface prepared them. That turns the next investigation of this shape from an afternoon into a few minutes. Isolated claims require an existing agent binding rather than accepting a null one, so a claim can no longer attach itself to a dispatch that has no live executor behind it.

  The same null-binding pattern is what made scope requests on that board die `worktree_unavailable` all session.

## v3.396.0 (2026-08-06)

### observability 0.3.1 → 0.3.2

#### Fixes

- The real-Collector tests run in CI again, without downloading inside the test (SQ-1375)
  Two tests check that our generated collector config is accepted by the actual pinned Collector binary, and that it converts delta sums and forwards gateway usage logs. They are the only tests that catch our config drifting away from what the real binary accepts; everything else validates our config against our own expectations.

  They had been fetching that binary over the network from inside the suite, within a 30 second per-file budget, which intermittently timed out and turned main red. The previous fix removed CI from the condition that enables them. The flake went away and so did the coverage: they now skip everywhere unless a developer sets `WORKBENCH_OTELCOL_CONTRIB` by hand, which in practice is never.

  CI now provisions the pinned Collector as a workflow step, cached on the runner and keyed by version, and exports `WORKBENCH_OTELCOL_CONTRIB` for the observability job. The tests find a configured binary, skip the download path entirely, and finish well inside their budget. The download helper stays for local use.

  The cache key is derived from `COLLECTOR_VERSION` rather than written out. A hardcoded version would keep hitting the cache after a bump, find the old binary already present, skip the download, and quietly check the config against the wrong Collector.

## v3.395.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.30.0 → 4.31.0

#### Features

- A dispatch that correctly changes nothing can now close itself (SQ-1339)
  A routed write dispatch that legitimately ends with nothing to commit had no legal way to close. `done` refused with `submission_required`. `submit` refused as `outside_scope` against the stale dispatch base. Pinning base equal to commit to prove emptiness refused as `empty_range`. The executor's only remaining move was to ask a human: "Someone with grooming/orchestrator authority needs to close this one manually."

  The surrounding refusals did not help either. Five separate runs hit "has routed dispatch history. Executors cannot close released repository work" without being told what they SHOULD do instead.

  `done` now accepts a routed write dispatch whose tree is clean since the dispatch base, recording the closure with explicit no-op evidence so grooming sees the truth rather than a fabricated change. `submit` gains an explicit no-op form that records an empty submission instead of refusing an empty range, for flows where the orchestrator wants something to integrate against. Refusals in this family now name the next legal action for the holder, and say what the orchestrator will do.

  The clean-since-base check shares delta semantics with shared-tree attribution, so a sibling executor's uncommitted work in the same tree does not block a no-op closure.

## v3.394.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.29.0 → 4.30.0

#### Features

- A dispatch that cannot possibly work in a worktree now says so before it runs (SQ-1364)
  Some projects structurally cannot use linked worktrees. A docker stack that bind-mounts the main checkout will never see the worktree as the running app, and a project whose corpus is gitignored sees an empty directory there. Nothing detected either shape, so every new orchestrator rediscovered it the same way: by dispatching, watching the executor fail on a missing app, diagnosing it, and re-dispatching into the main checkout. One such round trip measured 3m55s and 80.8k tokens.

  The mechanism to turn worktree isolation off has existed since 2026-07-25. Two boards that needed it never got it, which is the recurring failure where a mechanism ships and the configuration step that makes it useful does not.

  Dispatch now checks for the shape before spawning and warns in the result, naming the likely failure and the one-line fix, when an isolated dispatch targets a repository that a compose or docker file bind-mounts, or whose declared paths are gitignored. Worktree isolation is also surfaced in the orchestrator-facing board summary so it is visible when planning a wave rather than buried in CLI help.

  The setting is not flipped automatically. Guessing wrong strands an executor in the shared tree, which is worse than the problem being solved, so the board warns precisely and leaves the decision to a human or orchestrator.

#### Fixes

- Hook tests no longer read whichever plugin version happens to be installed (SQ-1376)
  Hooks resolve their runtime store from `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`. Spawned-hook tests did not pin that variable, so they inherited whatever the surrounding session had set, which in a Claude Code session is the INSTALLED plugin cache rather than the repo under test. The suite then exercised the installed version's code and reported on it as if it were the working tree.

  This turned a green suite into a coin flip that depends on which plugin version the developer has installed. Running the same commit with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` pointed at an installed 4.24.0 produced a failure in `quota-fallback.test.ts` that vanished the moment the variable was unset, with no code change in between. It also blocked the `integrate` preflight, which inherits the variable from the MCP server: four verified submissions had to be merged by hand because the preflight kept failing a test unrelated to any of them.

  The spawned-hook test setup now pins the plugin root to the repo, and an assertion fails the suite if any hook resolves a runtime outside it, so a leaked environment is a loud failure instead of a silently wrong result.

  Whether `runtimeModule()` should refuse a mismatched plugin root in production, rather than only in tests, is deliberately left open and tracked separately.

## v3.393.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.28.0 → 4.29.0

#### Features

- Shared-tree submissions attribute changes to the run that made them (SQ-1328)
  On boards that cannot use worktrees — BMR bans them, contractify must share because its docai container mounts the main checkout — the submit and done gates evaluated the whole dirty working tree. An executor was therefore blocked by its siblings' in-flight edits and by anything the user had left lying around. On 2026-07-31 all three executors of a BMR wave hit `unscoped_paths` and none of them could ever have submitted; nothing an executor could do would have helped.

  4.23.0 covered the half a launch-time snapshot can see: paths already dirty when the run started are exempt while their content is unchanged. This covers the half it cannot, a sibling's edits landing during the run, by attributing changes to the dispatch delta and the submitted range rather than to whole-tree state.

  Refusals on both entry points now name what the executor can actually act on, since a refusal improved on only the MCP handler or only the CLI leaves the other quietly unchanged.
- Executor worktrees fork from the branch you actually integrate into (SQ-1334)
  Worktrees forked from `origin/main`, so on any board where the user does not push, every executor started from a stale tree. Cantizans, 2026-07-31: origin was 15 commits behind local main, one executor's worktree was missing directories three delivered tickets had created, and that run was wasted outright. Setting `integrationMode: local` did not change the fork point, which made the setting a lie.

  Dispatch now syncs the worktree to the configured local integration branch, so `integrationMode: local` means what it says and an executor starts from the tree its work will be merged into.
- Planning warnings stop crying wolf on greenfield boards (SQ-1358)
  On Terge_VST, a greenfield project, ticket writes produced 22 warnings the orchestrator knew were wrong and dismissed every time: 12 saying declared file scope does not exist in the repo, 6 about a verify command changing to a directory that does not exist, and 4 stamping a category without reading the taxonomy. A warning dismissed 22 times has stopped being a warning.

  The scope and verify-path warnings now account for paths a ticket is about to create, which is the normal case on a new project rather than an error. The taxonomy warning was a straight false positive: it tracked process-local state in the MCP layer, so it fired regardless of whether the taxonomy had been read.
- Ending a turn no longer counts as an executor dying (SQ-1374)
  `SubagentStop` fires when a background agent ends a TURN, not when it is gone, and a background executor ends a turn every time it reports or waits on a ruling. The board read that as an observed death: the claim was auto-released and the dispatch went terminal, which also cleared the dispatch token a resumed executor needs in order to submit.

  One ticket produced all four consequences in a single run. The executor ended a turn to ask for scope, so the board marked it died. A steer back to it was refused as "already died" and became a comment the agent never saw. A replacement dispatch could not claim, did nothing, and cost 38.6k tokens. The original resumed, finished the work, verified it green, and was then auto-released before it could hand in, forcing a manual integration.

  A turn boundary is now recorded as a turn boundary. Auto-release requires a recorded terminal Agent failure, the kind 4.28.0 started observing from `PostToolUseFailure`. Pulse reports such an executor as waiting and says plainly that it may resume and must not be re-dispatched or released without that evidence, and a steer is refused only for a real terminal failure.

## v3.392.0 (2026-08-06)

### observability 0.3.0 → 0.3.1

#### Fixes

- The observability suite stops downloading a Collector mid-test on CI (SQ-1373)
  Two tests validated our generated config against a real OpenTelemetry Collector, and they ran only on CI, where no binary is configured — so each run fetched one over the network inside the suite's 30-second per-file budget. It timed out intermittently, turned main red, and through the publish guard that blocked releases for plugins nobody had touched.

  They now run only when `WORKBENCH_OTELCOL_CONTRIB` names a binary. The suite passes four consecutive runs in about two seconds.

  This trades the flake for the coverage: on CI those two tests now skip. SQ-1375 restores them properly, by provisioning the pinned binary as a cached workflow step so the test finds it instead of downloading it.

## v3.391.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.27.0 → 4.28.0

#### Features

- A dispatch that dies without a stop notification is now recorded (SQ-1356)
  4.16.0 records a `died` outcome from SubagentStop and the SessionEnd reconcile. A context-overflow death reaches neither: the agent is killed API-side mid-turn, so nothing stops and nothing reconciles. The board keeps showing a healthy claim on a corpse.

  It happened twice on this board while the ticket was open. SQ-1337's executor posted `[sidequest:verify-complete]` and then terminated with "Prompt is too long"; afterwards the dispatch still read `claimed`, `terminalAt` was null, and `claim.reclaimable` was null. Its finished work sat uncommitted in a worktree, found only because the harness told the orchestrator directly.

  The signal was already arriving and being ignored: `PostToolUseFailure` on `Agent` fires for exactly these failures, and the quota-fallback hook already parses the ref, the dispatch token, and the project out of the briefing prompt before returning early on anything that is not a quota error. A terminal Agent failure now records a `died` outcome through that same identity, so the claim becomes reclaimable and the sweep can act.

  Classification is deliberately narrow — context overflow, max tokens, and terminal agent shapes only. An error that cannot be classified confidently records nothing, because a missed death is recoverable by hand and a false death releases live work.

## v3.390.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.26.1 → 4.27.0

#### Features

- Verify commands are validated when recorded, not at integrate time (SQ-1331)
  Stored verify commands were never checked, so garbage surfaced at integrate — the worst possible moment, after an executor had already spent its run. On the-bot-resurrection 23 distinct tickets hit `verify_failed` at integrate and 6 hit `replay_failed`, over shapes like prose pasted into the verify field feeding pytest a bare `-;`, a `<scratchpad>` placeholder that cmd.exe parsed as redirects, and chained suites whose runner received a stray `;` fragment.

  Malformed verify commands are now rejected where they are written, with the problem named, so the ticket is fixed before anyone is dispatched against it.
- Integrate verifies the merged result and rolls back a bad merge (SQ-1332)
  Integrate ran its verify as a preflight against the PRE-merge tree, so whole classes of legitimate ticket could never pass: a greenfield ticket whose verify target is created by the merge (six bare `verify_failed` results with no explanation on midi-to-score), a ticket that adds the very tool its verify invokes, and any ticket whose job is fixing a red main — its verify is guaranteed to fail before its own fix lands.

  Verification now runs after delivery, against the tree that will actually exist, and a post-merge failure rolls the merge back rather than leaving it in place. Both entry points are covered: the MCP handler and the CLI command, which would otherwise have silently kept the old behaviour on whichever one was missed.
- The full suite stops thrashing when several run at once (SQ-1345)
  The parallel-first dispatch directive and the heavy full gate worked against each other. Every executor ends its ticket by running the same expensive suite at whatever moment it finishes, and that suite spawns real git init, worktree, and push operations plus temp directories. With three executors live the box carried 123 node processes, and runs interfered with each other's fixtures.

  The suite now isolates its shared resources per run, so concurrent invocations no longer contend for the same temp roots and fixture remotes.

  This ticket demonstrated its own thesis on the way in: its first submission could not verify because the full gate timed out under exactly the contention it exists to fix. Held rather than force-integrated, it passed 844/844 once the box was quiet.

#### Fixes

- Hook latency gate declines to judge a busy machine (SQ-1372)
  4.23.1 made the ceilings absolute and asserted them only off hosted runners, reasoning that the local box is the calibrated machine. That holds for a quiet local box and fails for a busy one: with three executors running, SessionStart "failed" at 744.6ms against its 500ms ceiling while a bare `node -e ''` took 535.8ms against a 40ms idle reference. The sample described the load.

  An overloaded run now reports its numbers and asserts nothing, saying so plainly: `(machine busy, process start 535ms vs 40ms idle: reported, not asserted)`. This is not 4.22.1's approach of scaling the budget by that same control, which flaked anyway because the hooks are I/O-bound and process start is not. Declaring a sample invalid is a different claim from stretching a threshold until it fits.

  Neither guard subsumes the other. A hosted runner asserts nothing because its I/O is unpredictable even when its CPU is idle — the run that proved it had a healthy 46ms control and a 1478ms p95. A loaded local box asserts nothing because the control itself proves the contention. What remains is the case the budgets were written for: a quiet local machine.

## v3.389.0 (2026-08-06)

### sidequest 4.26.0 → 4.26.1

#### Fixes

- Declared hook sources grant their compiled output (SQ-1344)
  4.13.0 made a declared source path grant its compiled twin, derived from the build script rather than configured by hand. Hooks were left out: `packageBuildOutputs` discovers a package's outputs by looking for `nonBundledBuildDirectories`, `--outdir` flags, and `outdir:` keys, and `buildHooks` writes an `outfile` instead. So a ticket declaring `plugins/sidequest/src/hooks/` never got `plugins/sidequest/hooks/`, and every hook change had to stop and ask for scope on its own build output. SQ-1327 hit it live.

  The discovery now recognises the `outfile` shape too, so `src/hooks/x.ts` pairs with `hooks/x.js`. The pairing stays flat and stays one-way: `src/hooks/shared/**` is bundled into each hook rather than emitted, so it is deliberately not paired, and declaring compiled output still does not grant its source.

## v3.388.0 (2026-08-06)

### codebase-mapper 2.13.0 → 2.14.0

#### Features

- codebase-mapper ships its map-state writer instead of describing it (SQ-1360)
  update-codebase-map asked the model to rewrite `.map-state.json` with today's date, the current commit, the document list, and SHA-256 hashes of every document's exact final bytes. That is mechanical work described in prose, so every workspace wrote a script for it and got to reintroduce the same bugs. On Terge_VST the orchestrator wrote its own `write-map-state.js` and invoked it twelve times, hand-patching a hardcoded document list as documents changed.

  `plugins/codebase-mapper/scripts/write-map-state.js` now ships with the plugin, taking `--project <dir>` the way live-rules' `sync-atomic-rules.js` does. It discovers documents from the map directory rather than a hardcoded list, reads the current commit (null outside a repository), and replaces the state file last. Both map skills invoke it instead of describing the computation.

### sidequest 4.25.0 → 4.26.0

#### Features

- A scope-request timeout can no longer discard verified work (SQ-1370)
  An executor on contractify held a verified commit, could not submit because of a file it had never touched, filed a scope request, and released the ticket to todo when that request timed out. The commit survived only because someone went looking for it, and the steering that arrived moments later landed on a released ticket.

  Releasing is the one move that throws work away: it clears the claim, invalidates the dispatch token, and drops the ticket back into the ready pool where a fresh dispatch starts over on a tree that already holds the work. So `releaseTicket` now refuses when a scope request is unresolved and the run has work in hand, naming the commit and pointing at `checkpoint`. Work in hand is evidence rather than a guess: a checkpoint commit, a submission commit, or scoped commits past the dispatch baseline, read through the same `scopedWorkPending` and `dispatchDelta` the done-no-op path already used.

  Two things deliberately unchanged. A run with genuinely nothing to hand in still releases cleanly. And the claim sweep still auto-releases a dead executor holding a pending scope request — it carries its own liveness evidence and is not a scope timeout, which is a distinction the guard keeps and a test pins.

  Executor guidance now matches what the store enforces: a `timeout` ruling is a wait, so checkpoint and hold with a commit and say which ruling is pending.

## v3.387.0 (2026-08-06)

### codebase-mapper 2.12.3 → 2.13.0

#### Features

- Workspace rule templates stop producing a permanent manifest mismatch (SQ-1359)
  Two defects that hit every workspace `init-workspace` sets up, both found the hard way on Terge_VST.

  The live-rules reference doc's example manifest entry omitted `priority` and `include`. `sameManifestEntry` compares a missing `priority` as 0 against the rule's actual 95, so every entry written from our own template mismatched, and the workspace got a manifest-mismatch warning injected on every prompt. The template now carries the fields the comparison reads.

  Hashes were computed over raw bytes, so a CRLF checkout of the same rule file hashed differently from an LF one and the manifest never matched. Both live-rules and codebase-mapper now normalize line endings before hashing, which also means a map or manifest built on one platform still verifies on another.

  Fixture hook spawns in the live-rules tests now pin `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to the fixture directory. The hooks prefer that variable over the fixture cwd, so 13 tests read the real repository's rules and failed whenever it was set — invisible in CI, which never sets it, and a phantom red for anything run from inside a session.

### sidequest 4.24.0 → 4.25.0

#### Features

- Worktree sweep gets quieter, remembers, and surfaces orphan branches (SQ-1337)
  The session-start worktree sweep injected noise into unrelated sessions and retried impossible deletions forever, while staying silent about the one thing worth saying. Across the-bot-resurrection sessions it made 38 injections naming seven unrelated projects and cost roughly 300 tokens prepended per session; les-undetectables saw 8 budget overruns from it.

  Four changes:

  - Sweep reporting is scoped to the session's own project instead of every board sharing a Sidequest home.
  - A deletion that fails for a permanent reason is remembered in sweep state rather than retried on every session start.
  - A worktree owned by another live session is skipped, tracked through a registered-session file that SessionStart writes and SessionEnd clears.
  - Orphan worktree branches, the thing a sweep is actually well placed to notice, are surfaced with their subject line, capped so a large backlog cannot flood the report.

  Delivered by orchestrator recovery: the executor verified green and then died at max_tokens before it could commit, so the work was recovered from its worktree and re-verified on the merged result.

#### Fixes

- Verify commands may run from the repository root (SQ-1357)
  The verify-command validator demanded `cd <repo-relative-dir> && <command>` and rejected commands that legitimately run from the repository root. On Terge_VST it refused three `add` calls in a row, each re-sending a multi-kilobyte ticket payload, over `cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build && ctest --test-dir build` — a command whose paths are already root-relative and which a cosmetic `cd .` does nothing for.

  A root-relative command is now accepted as written. The rule it was actually protecting stays: a command that depends on a subdirectory still has to say so.

### workbench 0.80.1 → 0.81.0

#### Features

- Workspace rule templates stop producing a permanent manifest mismatch (SQ-1359)
  Two defects that hit every workspace `init-workspace` sets up, both found the hard way on Terge_VST.

  The live-rules reference doc's example manifest entry omitted `priority` and `include`. `sameManifestEntry` compares a missing `priority` as 0 against the rule's actual 95, so every entry written from our own template mismatched, and the workspace got a manifest-mismatch warning injected on every prompt.

Both live-rules and codebase-mapper now normalize line endings before hashing, which also means a map or manifest built on one platform still verifies on another.

  Fixture hook spawns in the live-rules tests now pin `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` to the fixture directory. The hooks prefer that variable over the fixture cwd, so 13 tests read the real repository's rules and failed whenever it was set — invisible in CI, which never sets it, and a phantom red for anything run from inside a session.

### sidequest 4.23.1 → 4.24.0

#### Features

- Two guards stop reading progress as failure (SQ-1369)
  Both of these mistook "in progress" for "abandoned", which are opposite situations wanting opposite responses.

  The repeat-failure breaker refused a third dispatch with "two prior terminal dispatches without a commit" when attempt 2 had read its environment fine, reproduced every anchor, run the gate, committed, and checkpointed before running out of runway. It only skipped attempts whose outcome was `submitted`, so a checkpoint carrying a real commit still counted as a failure, and its environment-visibility remedy pointed at a hypothesis that attempt had already disproven. A terminal attempt now records the commit it produced, from the checkpoint or the submission, and an attempt carrying one is not a no-commit attempt.

  The Stop reminder read a running wave as unfinished business. Its exemption for live work required the dispatch's session id to match the session being reminded, and those diverge across a long orchestration, so an executor mid-run turned into "1 ticket still open. Update or close them before finishing" three times in one night. A ticket held by a claim that is not reclaimable, behind a dispatch that has not gone terminal, is now in progress regardless of which session prepared it. A direct claim with no live dispatch behind it is still the session's own to close and keeps its reminder, and pending submissions and scope requests are surfaced as before.

### sidequest 4.23.0 → 4.23.1

#### Fixes

- Hook latency budgets assert only where they are calibrated (SQ-1368)
  4.22.1 scaled the hook latency ceilings by a measured process-start control so a slower runner got a bigger budget. It flaked again on the next run: SessionStart came in at 1478ms p95 against a 1161ms scaled tail with the control reporting a healthy 46ms median. The hooks are I/O-bound and the control is not, so process-start time says nothing about how long an unlucky SQLite read takes on a shared VM.

  What this test protects is wall-clock on a developer's machine, so the ceilings are back to absolute numbers and are asserted only where they mean something. A hosted runner measures and reports the same figures as diagnostics without asserting them. The release gate is unchanged and unweakened: `cut.mjs` runs this suite locally before every cut, against the same ceilings it always used.

## v3.384.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.22.1 → 4.23.0

#### Features

- Shared-tree submissions stop gating on inherited working-tree dirt (SQ-1367)
  A shared tree is the user's own checkout, so it can already hold work that has nothing to do with the run. The submit gate treated every dirty path as the executor's: on contractify a screenshot the user had dropped in the repo root blocked a verified submission, the executor filed a scope request nobody could usefully rule on, the request timed out, and it released SQ-95 to todo with commit 8f5c22d9 still sitting there. The orchestrator's steering then arrived after the release and had to be recorded instead of applied.

  Every shared-tree dispatch now records what was already dirty at launch, with the same content-aware identity the artifact baseline uses. At submit, a reported out-of-scope path is exempt when its content is unchanged since that snapshot, and the exempted paths are recorded on the submission as `inheritedPaths`. Touching an inherited path puts it straight back under the gate, so this exempts what an executor found, never what it wrote. An unrecordable baseline means no exemption rather than a refused dispatch.

### sidequest 4.22.0 → 4.22.1

#### Fixes

- Hook perf ceilings calibrate to the machine running them (SQ-1366)
  The hook latency budgets were absolute wall-clock numbers set on one Windows box, so on a hosted runner they measured the runner. SubagentStart came in at 1088ms p95 against a 750ms ceiling with nothing wrong in the hooks, and the same test had passed on the commit before it.

  Each measurement already timed a bare `node -e ''` alongside the hook and never used it. That control is now the calibration: the budget stretches by however much slower process startup is than the 40ms reference. The tail assertion moved to twice the median budget, because a p95 over 20 samples is the second-slowest run and one descheduled process owns it. A hook that starts doing real work moves its median, which is where the signal was all along.

## v3.382.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.21.2 → 4.22.0

#### Features

- Test-scope auto-approval works in any repo layout (SQ-1365)
  Test-scope auto-approval now works in any repo layout. The detector was hardcoded to this marketplace's `plugins/<name>/test` shape, so every other project fell through to a full scope ruling: the executor stopped mid-run, the orchestrator woke up to approve `tests/`, and the round trip bought nothing that the commit-time scope check does not already catch. Terge_VST hit it three times in one session.

  A scope request is now auto-approved when every requested path sits in a test directory the ticket already reaches: an existing `test/`, `tests/`, `spec/`, `specs/`, or `__tests__/` beside a file the ticket declares, or beside any of its parents up to the repo root. A ticket owning `plugins/x/src/thing.ts` widens into `plugins/x/test/**`; one owning `src/synth.cpp` widens into the repo's `tests/**`; neither reaches the other's. The widening is recorded as a board comment and still reviewed at publish.

  The board flag is renamed `autoApproveTestScope` (`--no-auto-approve-test-scope`), and boards that explicitly set the old `autoApprovePluginTests` keep their setting.

#### Fixes

- Temp cleanup recognises its own directories when an ancestor is aliased (SQ-1363)
  The worktree sweep and the temp-root cleanup were the last Windows CI failures, and they had a different shape from the earlier path bugs: the leaf directory matched fine, but an ANCESTOR of the temp root carried an 8.3 alias. Canonicalizing the path being examined was not enough when the root it was compared against was spelled the other way, so cleanup skipped roots it owned and the sweep failed to recognise its own candidates.

  Both now compare through the same canonicalization, and both carry a test that builds a real alias locally rather than relying on a hosted runner to expose it.

### sidequest 4.21.0 → 4.21.1

#### Fixes

- Every worktree path comparison agrees on what a directory is called (SQ-1362)
  4.21.0 canonicalized worktree paths where the integration-advance code compares them, which fixed one family of failures and left the rest: commit and submit still refused an aliased worktree, and the sweeps still failed to recognise their own candidates. A directory reached by two spellings was still two directories to most of the code.

  The comparisons now run through one shared canonicalization instead of `path.resolve`, including the commit worktree-root check, which is the one that produced `worktree must name the git worktree root: C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...` while pointing at exactly the directory git had just named.

  The part worth keeping is the test. It builds a real 8.3 alias in the temp directory and drives a commit through it, so this class now fails on any machine instead of only on a hosted runner. It caught the incomplete fix immediately: the first round passed its own focused tests and still failed this one.

## v3.379.0 (2026-08-05)

### observability 0.2.2 → 0.3.0

#### Features

- Windows CI stops failing on paths that name the same directory twice (SQ-1353)
  Adding a Windows leg to CI turned up fourteen sidequest failures that pass on a local Windows machine, and they were all one bug. On the hosted runner git reports a temp worktree as `C:/Users/runneradmin/...` while Node keeps the 8.3 alias `C:\Users\RUNNER~1\...`. Those are the same directory, and `path.resolve` says they are not, so integration candidates looked ambiguous and shared-tree claims went unrecognised.

  Existing paths are now canonicalized before comparison, and every resolved drive root counts as protected rather than only the spelling the caller happened to use. This is production behavior, not a test accommodation: a machine whose temp directory carries a short-name alias was getting wrong answers about which checkout held a commit.

  Observability's Windows leg failed separately, on `EPERM` unlinking `otelcol-contrib.exe` while it was still locked. That one is genuinely test cleanup: the fixture now waits for the collector to exit before removing its runtime directory. It still runs a real collector and still proves it converted delta sums.

  None of this was visible from a developer machine. It took running the suite where it actually breaks.

## v3.378.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.20.0 → 4.20.1

#### Fixes

- Generated executor definitions can write again (SQ-1361)
  A board using per-ticket generated executor definitions could not get an executor off the ground: three consecutive dispatches of the same ticket were refused on their first guarded write, zero lines written between them, while the orchestrator hunted a stale claim that was never there.

  4.17.1 taught the write guard to resolve a ticket from the dispatch's recorded `agentName` as well as its bound id. But a generated definition does not run under that name; it runs under a name derived from it, `a` + launch name + `-` + hash, so comparing the two for equality never matched. A single active ticket hid this, because an unowned actor falls back to the sole active ticket in the session. With two tickets live at once that fallback is correctly ambiguous, so every write was refused instead.

  Identity now accepts the derived form. The refusal for a genuinely unowned actor with several tickets in flight is unchanged, which is the borrowing case this guard exists to prevent.

  Worth recording for the next person: the first version of this fix's test passed against the broken code, because one active ticket let the fallback mask the failed match. It only reproduced once a second concurrent claim was added, which is exactly what the affected board had.

## v3.377.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.19.0 → 4.20.0

#### Features

- A steer that arrives after the executor finished is kept, not lost (SQ-1355)
  Steering an executor that has just closed its ticket used to accomplish nothing. The teammate woke, the idle guard correctly refused to continue a terminal dispatch, and the instruction disappeared. The orchestrator found out by reading a transcript, and whatever it wanted to say had to be retyped somewhere durable.

  The race is unavoidable: the decision to steer is made from state that is already stale, and the executor can finish in between. So the message is now saved rather than merely detected. A `SendMessage` whose recipient resolves to a terminal dispatch writes the text to that ticket as an attributed comment, and the send is refused with the ticket ref, its outcome, and the next legal action: re-dispatch if the work itself has to change.

  Only recipients that resolve to a Sidequest dispatch are touched; ordinary teammate messages and steers to live executors pass through untouched. If the board cannot be read at all, the message is never blocked.

  This is the mirror of the scope-ruling delivery in 4.18.0, and the same principle decides both: the board is what survives, the mailbox is not.

- pulse shows the scope in force (SQ-1354)
  After granting scope, the obvious next question is whether the grant actually landed. `pulse` could not answer it: an orchestrator watching a wave had to shell out to `sidequest show <ref> --json` and filter the result through a python one-liner to read a ticket's files.

  `pulse` now carries a `scope` block: the file set commits are actually gated on, any pending request with the paths it asks for, and the last ruling with what it granted and refused. It is in the default compact read, not behind `detail`, because that is where the question gets asked. The declared list rides along only when it differs from what is enforced, which is exactly the case the existing scope-drift warning fires on.

## v3.375.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.18.0 → 4.18.1

#### Fixes

- The running-agent line reads like a sentence instead of a debug tag (SQ-1352)
  A dispatched executor used to render as `sidequest-exec-dispatch([model=GPT-5.6 Terra effort=high] docai: emit dossiers_list blocks) claude-codex-auto`. It now reads `GPT-5.6 Terra, high · docai: emit dossiers_list blocks`.

  The trailing `claude-codex-auto` stays, and it is worth knowing why. That label is the Agent-call model resolved locally before launch; no provider response updates it, so for anything routed through the gateway it can only ever show the virtual id we dispatch with. Making it show the real backend would mean going back to one agent definition per model and effort combination, which was removed for good reason: the route marker overwrites their pinned effort anyway, leaving thousands of injected tokens per session describing configuration nothing reads.

  So the description is the only place the real route appears while a run is in flight, which makes a paraphrased one genuinely costly. The dispatch result now says so and tells the caller to copy `spawn.description` byte-for-byte.

## v3.374.0 (2026-08-05)

### sidequest 4.17.1 → 4.18.0

#### Features

- A scope ruling now reaches the executor waiting for it (SQ-1348)
  An executor that paused for a scope ruling had no way to learn the ruling arrived. It ended its turn, the orchestrator granted or denied seconds later, and the work sat frozen until someone noticed and hand-resumed the agent. That happened three times in a single session, each costing a stop, an orchestrator round trip, and a resume.

  `scopeRequest` now takes `wait: true` and returns the ruling on that same call: granted, partially granted, denied, superseded, or timeout, along with the effective scope it leaves in force. The wait holds no board lock, so rulings, commits, and other tickets carry on normally while it blocks. On timeout the request stays pending and the response says to checkpoint and name what it is waiting on. Briefings tell executors to always pass it.

  The first design gave this its own `scopeWait` tool, which recreated the original problem in miniature: a second call an executor can forget to make. Folding it into the request removes that possibility, and it also kept the MCP tool list inside its byte budget, which several published tool descriptions were trimmed to respect.

  When a ruling lands on a ticket whose executor has already stopped, `scopeDeny` and scope-resolving updates now name that ticket and agent and say to resume it, so the orchestrator is told rather than left to remember.

#### Fixes

- Fix executors being refused every edit on boards using generated definitions (SQ-1351)
  4.16.0 made the write guard resolve a ticket from the acting agent's bound id and refuse rather than borrow a neighbour's scope. That was right for the case it fixed and wrong for two others, and it blocked a wave on a consumer board within a day.

  A per-ticket generated executor definition spawns under the dispatch's `agentName` as its own subagent type and never binds a runtime id, so matching on `agentId` alone found no owner and refused every write it attempted. Two executors on the same board failed identically, neither having touched a file. Identity now matches the dispatch's recorded name as well as its bound id.

  A helper spawned by an executor has the same problem from the other direction: its id belongs to no dispatch at all. It now inherits the sole active ticket in the session, which is unambiguous by construction. Two or more active tickets still refuse, which is the borrowing case 4.16.0 set out to stop.

## v3.372.0 (2026-08-04)

#### Features

- The test suite no longer needs a working gateway to pass, and CI runs on both platforms (SQ-1347) [`f5b4037`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f5b40370)
  CI had been red on every sidequest push for two days and nobody in the loop saw it, because every gate we run — executor verify, integrate, and the release cut — runs on Windows, where all 823 tests passed.

  Eight of the nine failures were one bug: fixtures that had nothing to do with routing were reaching a live model-gateway readiness probe through `prepareDispatch`. A machine with the gateway installed passed; CI and any fresh clone did not. Those fixtures no longer depend on an external binary. The ninth was a path comparison that chose case-sensitivity from `process.platform` instead of from the path in front of it. All nine were test-only: no shipped behavior was broken for non-Windows users, and the Linux suite now passes 823/823.

  Two changes make the gap unrepeatable. The plugin CI matrix runs Ubuntu and Windows, matching where the code actually gets developed. And the release cut now refuses to publish when the parent commit's Test workflow has not passed, so a red main cannot quietly become a release; local test remotes skip that GitHub-only check.

  Reproducing CI locally turns out to be cheap: pipe `git archive HEAD` into a `node:22` container, `git init` inside it so `build:check` has a repository, then run the suite.

- A dead executor now says so (SQ-1327) [`fbc4e2d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/fbc4e2d3)
  When a dispatched executor died mid-run, nothing on the board changed. The claim stayed live, `idleMs` counted up, and `pulse` reported `working: true` forever. On one board that meant an executor died right after posting BOOT and sat there for eighteen hours while a paid cloud pod kept billing, and another died before terminating its pod at all. The person watching became the death detector, and that board turned Sidequest off over it.

  A stop that leaves a live claim with no terminal board outcome now records a durable `died` outcome with its timestamp and last activity, from both the SubagentStop path and the SessionEnd reconcile. The orchestrator gets told which ticket died, when it went quiet, and what it left behind, instead of discovering it by hand-inspecting worktrees.

  `pulse` carries a real `liveness` reading rather than an idle counter that everyone misread as one. An active verify reads alive, because a verify-start with no verify-complete is positive evidence of a live process; waiting is reserved for a pending scope request or a steering hold; a stop observed during active verification records died. The repeat-dispatch breaker counts died rounds as the durable terminal outcomes they are.

  Briefings now tell executors to record billable external resources on the ticket as they create them and terminate them before any stop, including error paths, so a dead executor's cloud spend is reapable from the ticket thread.

  This one was written from a live specimen: the session running it crashed with four executors claimed, and every one of them sat at `working: true` with nothing to distinguish four dead processes from four thinking ones.
- Guards stop refusing work they were never meant to block (SQ-1330) [`0c4f680`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0c4f6805)
  Two guards were firing on things that were never dangerous.

  The scope guard refused helper writes to the harness's own scratchpad, the directory executors are told to use for temp files. The observed workaround is the whole problem: an executor refused the scratchpad path, then wrote the identical script into the repository working tree two tool calls later. Scratchpad paths are now always writable, and single-file deletes there are allowed.

  The recursive-delete guard, added after a real `$home` wipe, had drifted into matching the user-profile path prefix rather than an actual recursive delete. It blocked a plain `grep -n`, three heredoc writes, and one `rm -f` of a single scratchpad file, deleting nothing in any of them. It now requires both a genuine recursive delete verb and a target resolving to the profile or `.claude` root. The original incident's commands still block, pinned by fixture.

  The third complaint in this batch turned out to be already fixed: the worktree isolation guard no longer intercepts Bash commands at all, so the 220 refusals across 110 executor sessions came from an older build. That one ships as a fixture pinning the current behavior, not a change.
- Removed a dispatch warning that was wrong 180 times out of 180 (SQ-1335) [`2d29cd1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2d29cd1e)
  Dispatch used to warn when a symbol named in a ticket "does not appear on main". On one board it fired about 180 times over seven dispatch rounds and was never once correct. It flagged a Sidequest comment id as a missing code symbol, which by construction can never appear in a repository. Two executors released their tickets over it, and the orchestrator ended up telling every executor in its spawn prompt to ignore the warning, because otherwise each one burned a turn re-verifying a false alarm.

  The check and its supporting machinery are gone, and a test pins them gone.

  A signal that is wrong every time is worse than no signal: it costs a turn per dispatch and it teaches people to ignore the channel that carries the true warnings too. This is the same call as the oversized-skill guard: mechanisms that ask an agent to predict get removed, mechanisms that verify a fact stay.

  Setting up telemetry needs a Claude Code restart, and the skill used to send you back in with a fresh `/workbench:init-workspace`. That works, but it starts the skill over and makes it recover your answers from the bootstrap plan.

  It now asks you to come back with `claude --continue` instead, so the run keeps its own answers across the restart. The reload-boundary fallback says the same thing for the same reason.

- The write guard stops refusing an executor's own file inside its worktree (SQ-1329) [`30ea9dd`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/30ea9ddf)
  An executor working in its own linked worktree could have its own declared file refused, with the refusal naming a completely different ticket. The guard was comparing the full worktree-prefixed path against repo-relative declared scope, and when that failed to match it fell through to whichever ticket's scope looked closest. On one board that cost two dispatches released with zero files changed, plus the workaround that follows from it: re-dispatch with `sharedTree: true` and throw away isolation entirely.

  The guard now resolves exactly one active ticket from the acting subagent's bound `agentId`, and strips `.claude/worktrees/<any name>/` before comparing paths. An unbound identity is refused outright rather than borrowing another ticket's scope, so a refusal can no longer name a ticket the executor isn't working on.

  Tests cover the observed non-`agent-*` worktree name, two concurrent tickets staying isolated from each other, and the unbound refusal.

#### Fixes

- Pin that read-only executors keep their board tools (SQ-1338) [`2974fdf`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2974fdfa)
  Two read-only executors on another board died at claim on 2026-08-01 with no board MCP tools reachable at all, and the workaround was to flip the tickets to writable and route them through the writing executor: changing what a ticket is allowed to do in order to dodge a plumbing problem.

  A live probe on current code settled it. A read-only executor claims fine today and sees the full board toolset. The August failure came from a short-lived allowlist that named board tools explicitly; SQ-1279 already replaced it with the deny-list shape, which restricts write, publish, and browser tools and leaves MCP attachment alone.

  What ships here is the guard against a repeat: a contract assertion that generated read-only definitions never deny a Sidequest board MCP tool. Read-only refers to the repository, never to the board.

  When installed Toolshed plugins moved ahead of what a session had loaded, Workbench blocked the prompt: it echoed the text back and told you to reload. That fired seven times across four projects in a week, and one of those prompts carried an attached image, which the echo cannot return. The cost landed entirely on the person retyping.

  The prompt now goes through, carrying one session-scoped warning that the session is running stale plugin code and a reload is worth doing. One warning per session per version change, not per prompt. The blocking path is gone along with the automation and dev exemptions that existed only to soften it.

  Version drift almost never makes the current prompt unsafe to answer, so the advisory had no business being a gate.

  Spawned executors inherit the orchestrator session's working directory. When that session sits inside a stale leftover worktree (one the sweep cannot remove because a live session's cwd can't be deleted), every sharedTree executor starts its shell in the wrong tree. Observed on another board: an executor lost ~90 seconds discovering this, and the orchestrator resorted to hand-writing "cd here first, verify show-toplevel" prose into every dispatch message.

  The sharedTree briefing now carries that binding itself: the worktree-identity packet instructs the executor to `cd` to the shared checkout before any git or file operation, confirm `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` prints it, and stop and report if the mismatch persists rather than writing anything in the wrong tree. Isolated dispatches keep their existing self-check contract unchanged.

  Dispatch also gained a verifier: when the board server's own working directory lies inside a `.claude/worktrees/` path, the dispatch result warns the orchestrator that spawned executors will inherit a stale-worktree cwd, and the same warning reaches the executor's flagged-uncertainty packet. Detection only covers sessions launched inside a worktree; that partial coverage is deliberate, and it never blocks a dispatch.

- Declared source scope grants its compiled output, derived from the build itself (SQ-1320) [`ab07715`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ab07715b)
  Sidequest compiles `src/` to tracked output under `lib/` and `bin/`, and every ticket had to declare both sides of that mapping by hand. Forgetting the compiled twin was the single most common scope miss: four incidents in one day, including a scope request naming a compiled path that does not exist because CLI modules land in `bin/`, not `lib/`.

  Declared scope now expands through one resolver: declaring `src/lib/store.ts` grants `lib/store.js`, with the mapping derived from the build script's own exported layout rather than a second hardcoded copy. The dispatch snapshot, commit enforcement, the completion tree check, and every scope-edit path read the same expanded set, so they cannot disagree.

  The expansion is one-directional on purpose. Along the way the executor found that the existing `generatedPairs` machinery quietly granted sources from declared generated output, the exact backwards grant that lets someone edit compiled files without their source; that inverse path is removed, and declaring `lib/store.js` alone no longer reaches `src/lib/store.ts`.

  Three executors in one day stopped mid-verify the same way: they backgrounded the long final suite, their bounded turn ended while waiting, and the claim sat in verify-marker limbo until someone resumed them by hand with the same instruction each time. That instruction is now in every dispatch briefing with a verify command: run the declared verify in the foreground with a timeout sized to the command, kill any earlier backgrounded verify first so two builds never race in one tree, and do the whole closeout (verify-complete marker, negative control, submission, final report) in that same turn.

  A dispatched executor's worktree holds tracked files only, so a ticket whose real work reads gitignored state (a data directory, local fixtures, an env file) dies the same environmental death on every attempt, and it presents as a vague failure rather than a missing-file error. One board burned three dispatches and 125k tokens on a single read-only ticket that way.

  Dispatch now warns up front: path-like tokens from the ticket's files, verify command, and description are tested with `git check-ignore`, and anything ignored AND absent from the tree gets named in a warning with the two remedies (`sharedTree: true`, or run it inline). Ignored-but-present paths like `npm ci`-installed `node_modules` stay silent, because a warning that fires on every JS ticket is noise that trains you to skip warnings. It stays a warning, never a refusal: the detection is heuristic.

  And a third dispatch after two durable terminal no-commit rounds is blocked, with environment visibility named as the leading hypothesis. Only durable terminal outcomes count — a still-claimed record whose stop hook never arrived proves nothing either way. `allowRepeatFailure` (CLI `--allow-repeat-failure`) overrides explicitly, and taking the override is recorded on the ticket.

## v3.364.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.10.0 → 4.11.0

#### Features

- The oversized-skill guard is gone (SQ-1323) [`b12fa0e`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/b12fa0ee)
  The guard denied dispatched executors any bundled skill whose entry file crossed 256KB, pointing them at a targeted Read instead. In practice its one observed activation blocked a 262KB skill and the executor immediately pulled 278KB of the same material over WebFetch: a wasted turn and nothing prevented. A guard whose bypass is cheaper than its compliance doesn't shape behavior, it just adds friction and teaches executors that guards are noise. Removed outright, and the hook-registration test now asserts the Skill matcher stays gone.

## v3.363.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.9.0 → 4.10.0

#### Features

- Scope requests fail open, resolve partially, and never desync the dispatch record (SQ-1321) [`d97b27d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/d97b27d1)
  Every project running Sidequest was getting stuck on scope. Four incidents on the toolshed board in one day, plus a board where an unbound dispatch (`agentId: null, boundAt: null`) made every scope request fail `worktree_unavailable` for the executor and the orchestrator alike, on a live claim neither could fix.

  Four changes. The scope-request marker is now a best-effort recovery breadcrumb instead of a gate, so a request always files even when the worktree never bound. A files update by a distinct control-plane identity now rules on the pending request: requested paths inside the new scope are granted, the rest refused, with a comment naming both, so correcting one bad path in an otherwise good request no longer strands the run in a state where the request can neither be re-filed nor approved. `dispatch.declaredFiles`, which is what commit enforcement actually reads, now follows every successful files update and every denial, and `pulse` warns when a legacy record still diverges from the ticket. Denial comments state the scope actually in force instead of asserting it "remains unchanged" two lines under a ruling that changed it.

## v3.362.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.8.0 → 4.9.0

#### Features

- Releasing a ticket as a contradiction now needs the probe and its output (SQ-1317) [`a23382d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a23382d1)
  SQ-1313 made technical blockers carry the failing command, its exit code, and its output. Contradictions carried nothing, which is backwards: "the ticket names something that doesn't exist" is an assertion about the world, so it's the claim that most needs showing rather than describing.

  It was wrong twice in one day. One release claimed a plugin was absent; another claimed `src/lib/store.ts` and its symbols were absent, having checked with an exact path glob, a directory glob, and a content search. A second executor on the same ticket and the same base found every file exactly where the ticket said and committed the work. Each incident cost a full dispatch cycle plus an orchestrator re-deriving the claim by hand to find it false, and in both cases one line of real output would have settled it in seconds.

  So `contradiction` now requires `command` and `outputTail` through the same shared validator technical blockers already use. `exitCode` stays optional here, because a glob that legitimately matches nothing exits 0 and demanding non-zero would just push executors into misreporting. `scope_pause` and `handback` still need no evidence.

## v3.361.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.7.0 → 4.8.0

#### Features

- Completion is refused when a change's own tests pass against the pre-change code (SQ-1315) [`38da216`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/38da2167)
  A green suite proves nothing if the tests never touch the code that changed. SQ-1294 shipped 151 passing tests over a bug that was still there, and neither of the existing gates caught it: the diff wasn't empty and no blocker was claimed.

  So when a completion's in-scope changes include both test-side and non-test-side files, the claim holder now has to record a negative control: revert the non-test paths to the dispatch base, re-run the changed tests, and report `[sidequest:negative-control] <command> failed=<n>`. `failed=0` is a refusal, because tests that pass against the pre-change code aren't testing the change. Refactors and coverage-only work take `[sidequest:negative-control] waived <reason>` at 20 characters or more, so skipping the control is a recorded statement rather than silence.

  The check only fires when it can see a test file in the changed scope, and the existing empty-diff refusal still comes first. Measured on two real commits before shipping: the SQ-1294 fix goes 20/0 to 18/2 under reversion, and SQ-1313 goes 107/0 to 104/3. Where build output is tracked, reverting every non-test path reverts source and compiled output together, so no rebuild is needed and the control costs about one extra scoped run.

## v3.360.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.6.0 → 4.7.0

#### Features

- "I am blocked" carried no burden of proof (SQ-1313) [`30ea7cb`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/30ea7cb6)
  A completion claim eventually meets a verify. A blocker claim met nothing: `release --reason` was free text, so a run could end by asserting a build failure or a hung suite and the board would record the assertion verbatim. Every blocker claimed in one day's work turned out to be false. A plugin reported absent was present, a suite reported hung passed 800 tests in three and a half minutes, and generated-output drift exited clean on the very checkpoint that reported it. Each took under five minutes to disprove, which is the problem: a false blocker is indistinguishable from a real one until someone spends the five minutes, so every release had to be treated as suspect.

  Releases now carry a `kind`, and a `technical_blocker` must supply the failing command, its exit code, and an output tail. A scope pause, a ticket-versus-code contradiction, and a deliberate handback stay a single call with nothing to prove, because those are honest and making them expensive would train executors out of the one behavior that already works. MCP and the CLI share the same predicate, so neither surface can become the lenient one.

## v3.359.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.6 → 4.6.0

#### Features

- A completion claim never met the tree, so "verified" survived a byte-identical diff (SQ-1312) [`27e524a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/27e524a0)
  `[sidequest:verify-complete]` was only ever a liveness marker, there to stop a long verify from being reclaimed. Nothing checked that the command ran, that it passed, or that anything changed. The real diff was computed from git, but only at submission, which shared-tree runs never reach. So an executor could report three corrections applied and post verification complete against a tree byte-identical to before it started, and the first thing to notice would be a human reading the diff. Across two projects in one day that happened five times, with the orchestrator manually checking the tree every time and saying so on the ticket.

  A write-scope ticket whose declared files show an empty diff since its dispatch base is now refused at completion, naming the files and offering `[sidequest:verify-complete] no-op` for the legitimately empty run. Read-only tickets are untouched, since delivering a comment and changing nothing is their whole job. Where a submission is genuinely missing, the existing refusal still wins: it names a more specific next action.

## v3.358.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.5 → 4.5.6

#### Fixes

- Scope refusals told the orchestrator to act as its own executor (SQ-1309) [`ac738a3`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ac738a35)
  Refusing a scope change under a live claim pointed the caller at `scope-request --by <claim.by>`, which is the executor's identity, so an orchestrator following the message was impersonating the agent it had dispatched. The advice was not even needed: the guard already lets a caller through when it supplies a `by` of its own, and the orchestrator was only refused because it passed none. One run retried the same call three times and escalated to the CLI, pulling two full usage dumps into context, for something one field would have solved. The refusal now branches: with no `by` it names re-running under your own identity, and the scope-request path stays for the claim holder, where it is correct. The same audit removed a matching instruction to release as another agent.
- The browser/visual planning warning fired on any ticket whose prose mentioned a browser (SQ-1310) [`e8510ac`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e8510acb)
  The warning matched `browser|visual|screenshot|playwright|ui review|e2e` against a ticket's title and description, so a readonly ticket earned a "may need a driver script" warning for merely mentioning one of those words. A source-reading audit that said "PHP/frontend can render" got it; so did a stack-reproduction spike whose title contained "403 on click". Neither goes near a browser. The subject being the frontend is not the method being a browser, and prose cannot tell those apart. It now keys on the category that actually means "judged through screenshots", matching both the current `visual-evaluation` id and the legacy `visual-review` one, since boards seeded before the rename still carry the old id and nothing aliases them.
- Two Windows traps whose errors point away from their own cause (SQ-1311) [`698c50a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/698c50a4)
  `docker exec -w /app` fails with `Cwd must be an absolute path`, and `/app` is absolute: Git Bash's MSYS2 layer rewrites it before docker sees it, so the error blames the one argument that was correct. `Start-Process -FilePath "npm"` fails with `%1 is not a valid Win32 application`, which reads like a corrupt Node install when the real story is that npm is a `.cmd` shim. Both cost an agent a dead tool call and then send it hunting in the wrong direction. The existing Windows guard only caught `C:\...` paths going into Bash; these are the same hazard from angles it did not cover. Both now warn with the corrected command spelled out, and neither denies, because they are legitimate commands with a platform-specific spelling.

## v3.357.0 (2026-08-03)

### model-gateway 0.47.1 → 0.48.0

#### Features

- The shim worker binds its own port and reports it, instead of the supervisor guessing (SQ-1307) [`0e79ad4`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0e79ad46)
  The worker port was computed as 20000 + (supervisorPort % 20000), which is the identity function for every port in 20000-39999. On Linux, whose default ephemeral range overlaps that band, the worker was told to bind the port the supervisor already held, never started, and hung the suite until the six-hour CI job timeout. Windows never reached it because its dynamic range starts above 49152. No arithmetic fixes this: any computed port is a guess about what is free while the OS allocates from the same space, and a first attempt using supervisorPort + 1 traded the Linux failure for a Windows one. The worker now binds an ephemeral port and reports it to the supervisor over IPC. A missing report is a bounded, named startup failure rather than a silent fallback.

## v3.356.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.4 → 4.5.5

#### Fixes

- Dispatch guard no longer mistakes a --test flag for the test glob (SQ-1308) [`b9fc515`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/b9fc5155)
  The runnability check took the first token after --test as the file pattern, so once fallback suites gained --test-timeout it read the flag as a glob, matched nothing, and refused every ticket carrying the command the resolver itself derives. It now skips flags to find the glob, and the suggested replacement comes from the resolver rather than a second hardcoded copy that could drift.

## v3.355.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.3 → 4.5.4

#### Fixes

- Approving a scope request left the executor blocked until it re-ran the check itself (SQ-1304) [`7456d60`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7456d600)
  Denying a scope request was one orchestrator call. Approving one was an update, a message to the executor, and a re-run by the executor, because adding the requested path to the declared files never cleared the pending request. The orchestrator could not finish its own approval either: `requestScope` refuses anyone but the claim holder, so trying to confirm an approval it had just granted came back `not_owner`, which reads like a denial. Measured on a real run, an executor sat blocked for about seven minutes on a file that had been approved the whole time, and the same round trip happened twice on one ticket. Declared-file updates now resolve a scope request they fully cover, and the refusal names the next legal action instead of only its precondition.

## v3.354.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.2 → 4.5.3

#### Fixes

- A hanging test now names itself instead of stalling CI (SQ-1303) [`21f0134`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/21f0134e)
  Fallback suites run with node --test --test-timeout=30000, so a test that hangs fails with its own name and location instead of stalling silently. The affected-plugin CI job also gained timeout-minutes: 10; it previously had no timeout at all, so one hung test held the workflow concurrency slot for the GitHub six-hour default and every release queued behind it was evicted. Measured headroom: the slowest legitimate fallback test is 4.5s and the slowest whole suite 18.3s.

## v3.353.0 (2026-08-03)

### observability 0.2.1 → 0.2.2

#### Fixes

- Every Loki panel was empty because the bucket variable shipped an unresolvable auto value (SQ-1302) [`3370661`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/33706618)
  The `bucket` interval variable shipped with Grafana's legacy `$__auto_interval_bucket` auto value, and that string reached Loki verbatim: `not a valid duration string`. The same query with a real range selector returned six models, so the data and the queries were fine the whole time. Nine panels were dead on it, covering gateway routing, context-window growth, cache economics, and hook health, and they failed as "No data" rather than an error, so a broken panel looked exactly like a quiet day. Generation now refuses any dashboard still carrying a `$__auto_interval_*` value, alongside the existing check that every referenced variable is declared.

## v3.352.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.1 → 4.5.2

#### Fixes

- The executor skill guard denied on a hardcoded guess, and readonly categories flagged their own artifact roots (SQ-1299) [`5309825`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/53098253)
  Two guards that fired on the wrong evidence.

  The oversized-skill guard summed a skill's entire directory tree against a 256 KiB budget, but skills load progressively, so the number it judged was a worst case that mostly never enters context. Worse, when it could not locate the skill directory it fell back to a hardcoded size and denied on that: an executor was blocked from `claude-api` by a constant, then pulled more than the budget through WebFetch instead. It now measures what actually loads and fails open when it cannot measure.

  Separately, a readonly category warned about write intent even when the ticket's declared scope sat entirely inside that category's own `artifactRoots`. `codebase-exploration` declares `.claude/.codebase-info` as an artifact root and its contract permits exactly that write, so the one flow the feature exists to serve was the flow that needed an override. The check now consults the roots it already declares.

## v3.351.0 (2026-08-03)

### codebase-mapper 2.12.2 → 2.12.3

#### Fixes

- The map update instruction told the model to end its turn, so the skill never ran (SQ-1295) [`be65277`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/be652774)
  The injected instruction said to "end with" the line announcing that the map update is running. A turn that has ended cannot contain the tool call that was supposed to follow, so sessions closed on "Running /codebase-mapper:update-codebase-map" and the map never got updated. It read as done to anyone skimming, which is how it survived. The announcement now comes before the action and says outright that announcing is not doing, and a Stop hook blocks the turn when the claim was made without the skill actually being invoked. The block skips subagents, skips the "no updates needed" ending, and won't fire twice in a row.

## v3.350.0 (2026-08-03)

### observability 0.2.0 → 0.2.1

#### Fixes

- Grafana setup mounted the template dashboards, so per-project boards never showed (SQ-1294) [`877dbdd`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/877dbddb)
  The container gets created two ways and only `ensure` mounted the generated dashboards. The setup path passed no `dashboardDir`, so it fell back to the plugin's static template folder, which only ever holds `claude-code-usage.json` — one dashboard in Grafana no matter how many projects opted in. It also never self-healed, because the "is this container current?" check looked at image, version labels and port bindings but not the mount, so a bad container survived every later `ensure`. Both paths now provision from the opted-in project registry and pass the generated directory, and a container whose dashboard mount doesn't match gets force-recreated.

## v3.349.0 (2026-08-03)

### model-gateway 0.47.0 → 0.47.1

#### Fixes

- Test listeners get real ephemeral ports instead of a shared fixed one (SQ-1292) [`ae349f9`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ae349f99)
  Asking the shim for an ephemeral port did not give you one: the worker port was computed as 20000 + (port % 20000), so a requested port of 0 collapsed to a hardcoded 20000 for every caller. Parallel test files then collided on it, the shim failed to start, and the CI job either failed with EADDRINUSE or hung to the six-hour timeout. The worker port is now derived from the port the OS actually assigned, and both the supervisor and worker log the port they bound rather than the one they asked for.

## v3.348.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.5.0 → 4.5.1

#### Fixes

- Hook latency budgets are absolute, not a ratio to process start (SQ-1290) [`edfc1de`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/edfc1de8)
  The perf test asserted each hook's median against 10x a bare process-start control measured on the same machine. Linux spawns a process in about 23ms and Windows in about 45ms, so the same hook cost passed locally and failed on CI: the faster the hardware, the tighter the budget. Budgets are now absolute wall-clock ceilings, and failures print the measured value, the applied ceiling, and the control.

## v3.347.0 (2026-08-03)

### sidequest 4.4.3 → 4.5.0

#### Features

- Dispatch refuses a verify command that cannot run (SQ-1288) [`361539d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/361539d7)
  A ticket whose verify command could never execute used to spawn an executor anyway, which explored, hit ENOENT, and released without doing any work. Dispatch now checks that the command after the cd can actually run (npm script present, test glob matching files) and refuses before spawning, naming the command derived from the tree instead. The resolver is shared with the release cut rather than duplicated. Malformed legacy verify strings stay advisory; only the provably-unrunnable class refuses.

## v3.346.0 (2026-08-03)

### model-gateway 0.46.4 → 0.47.0

#### Features

- One command updates the gateway, on every platform (SQ-1287) [`6911ac4`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6911ac41)
  The proxy binary is now swapped by renaming the old one aside rather than copying over it. A running executable cannot be overwritten (EBUSY) or deleted (EPERM) on Windows, and overwriting one on Linux gives ETXTBSY, but renaming works everywhere and the running process keeps serving from the renamed file. The upgrade no longer stops the proxy to swap the file, and a failed swap can restore the previous binary because the canonical path is free by then. A stable launcher means the documented command carries no plugin version and never goes stale.

### workbench 0.78.0 → 0.79.0

#### Features

- One command updates the gateway, on every platform (SQ-1287) [`6911ac4`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6911ac41)

## v3.345.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.4.2 → 4.4.3

#### Fixes

- submit refuses a verify string integration would later reject (SQ-1286) [`11845b2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/11845b25)
  The verify shape check ran only at integration time, reading the submission's copy. An executor could submit a green run with an unrunnable verify string, and by the time integrate refused it the executor was gone and editing the ticket's verify field had no effect. submit now applies the same predicate, so the executor is told while it can still resubmit.

## v3.344.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.4.1 → 4.4.2

#### Fixes

- Publish-lock refusals name the expected and found session ids (SQ-1140) [`c047bc2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/c047bc2a)
- Dispatch executor defs no longer render effort: max (SQ-1285) [`9b8a888`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/9b8a8882)
  The two collapsed dispatch executor definitions rendered frontmatter `effort: max` so their maxTurns picked up the 250-turn backstop. Only the gateway's marker path rewrites effort, and that path requires the requested model to be `auto`; a request naming a concrete Claude model forwards effort untouched. WebSearch's internal call is such a request, so `max` reached Anthropic and 400'd on a thinking-disabled model. maxTurns is now derived independently of the rendered effort.

## v3.343.0 (2026-08-02)

### codebase-mapper 2.12.1 → 2.12.2

#### Fixes

- Subagents never update the codebase map (SQ-1259) [`2e6ee7a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2e6ee7a4)
  The mapper's SubagentStart hook was injecting the main session's update-the-map instruction into executors; subagents now get an explicit prohibition and hand-back, and the executor template carries the same rule.

### sidequest 4.4.0 → 4.4.1

## v3.342.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.3.0 → 4.4.0

#### Features

- Collapse the Codex dispatch executors to two (SQ-1281) [`f451be4`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f451be4b)
  Model and effort both ride the dispatch route marker, so the per-effort Codex defs carried dead frontmatter. 12 definitions and 1,280 injected tokens, from 27 and 8,402. Legacy names still classify so old dispatch records heal by redispatch.

## v3.341.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.2.0 → 4.3.0

#### Features

- Express read-only executors as a deny list (SQ-1279) [`085c5ac`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/085c5ac6)
  The allow list named all 54 board tools to exclude three writers, hid every later-added tool, and blocked Playwright from visual-review. Injected frontmatter 7,616 -> 2,188 tokens.

## v3.340.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.1.2 → 4.2.0

#### Features

- Restore the orchestration engine (SQ-1273) [`403d8e5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/403d8e5c)
  The strip was justified by md-bench, which measured single-context work; this repo's work routinely overflows the window, where executors amortize context instead of re-billing it every turn. Restored from v3.335.0; board and all 14 category routes survived intact.

## v3.339.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.1.1 → 4.1.2

#### Fixes

- Revert the PreCompact continuity injection (SQ-1277) [`5193da0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/5193da01)
  Countering a Claude Code summarization behavior with unmeasured prompt text was the wrong fix. The Stop-hook wording fix and the closed coverage gap both stay.

## v3.338.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.1.0 → 4.1.1

#### Fixes

- Repair the MCP tools the orchestration strip broke (SQ-1272) [`0bf43ab`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0bf43ab6)
  done, plan and groomClose all threw on first call because their handlers still reached for deleted lib modules through an untyped require(); plan is removed, the other two repaired, and a surface test now exercises every advertised tool.

## v3.337.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 4.0.0 → 4.1.0

#### Features

- Stop compaction summaries reading as a stop signal (SQ-1276) [`4895997`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/4895997a)
  PreCompact always emits a continuity instruction so a summary cannot record context pressure as a decision or handoff; the Stop-hook suggestion now says checkpoint, not stopping point.

## v3.336.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 3.56.1 → 4.0.0

#### Breaking changes

- Sidequest orchestration is removed; the board is a tracker (SQ-1271) [`a1306b2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a1306b219af661aac0d8658cc0b011d019947870)
  Dispatch, routing, categories, executors, claims, submissions, scope enforcement, and worktree management are gone. 25,682 source lines to 10,107; 55 MCP tools to 16; 13 hook events to 5. The board still captures, tracks, links, and closes tickets, and Claude no longer picks work off it unprompted. Fan-out and model-selection guidance moved to the playbook plugin. Staying on orchestration means staying on 3.335.0.

### workbench 0.77.0 → 0.78.0

#### Features

- Sidequest orchestration is removed; the board is a tracker (SQ-1271) [`a1306b2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a1306b219af661aac0d8658cc0b011d019947870)
  Dispatch, routing, categories, executors, claims, submissions, scope enforcement, and worktree management are gone. 25,682 source lines to 10,107; 55 MCP tools to 16; 13 hook events to 5. The board still captures, tracks, links, and closes tickets, and Claude no longer picks work off it unprompted. Fan-out and model-selection guidance moved to the playbook plugin. Staying on orchestration means staying on 3.335.0.

## v3.335.0 (2026-08-02)

### model-gateway 0.46.3 → 0.46.4

#### Fixes

- Observability is its own plugin, and skill-retro is now playbook (SQ-1270) [`110e82d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/110e82db5ff54644fef14c3f0f8dd779b79581bf)
  Workbench keeps setup, updates, and health. Telemetry, the statusline, and the Collector move to the new user-scoped observability plugin. skill-retro becomes playbook and gains fan-out, verify-discipline, and pick-model. Reinstall skill-retro@eigenwise-toolshed as playbook@eigenwise-toolshed.

## v3.334.0 (2026-08-02)

### sidequest 3.55.0 → 3.56.0

#### Features

- Dispatched executors are blocked from loading oversized bundled skills (SQ-1251) [`96597ca`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/96597cad)
  The bundled `claude-api` skill is 932 KB across 64 files. `shared/model-migration.md` alone is 176 KB, roughly 44k tokens, and a full load runs to about 230k. An executor that reached for it to check one SDK signature spent its whole context budget on reference material, which is the entire budget for a routed executor doing a small ticket.

  A PreToolUse guard now refuses a `Skill` call from a dispatched executor when the skill's directory exceeds 256 KB, and points at a targeted `Read` or a research ticket instead. It matches on the skill name rather than its location, since the bundled path is content-hashed per Claude Code version and would go stale on every upgrade, and it falls open on any error so a guard bug can never block work. The executor briefing says the same thing in prose, so the rule is visible before the refusal fires. Orchestrators and non-dispatched agents are unaffected.
- Scope requests can be denied over MCP, not only approved (SQ-1252) [`a40c7d3`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a40c7d3f)
  An executor could ask to widen its scope, and an orchestrator over MCP had no way to say no. A pending request blocks the board `commit` tool, and the only things that cleared it were approving the exact paths you meant to refuse, or releasing the ticket and throwing away finished work. The CLI had a deny; MCP did not, and the refusal message named only the approve path. Denial was reachable only through an overload where omitting `files` and passing a `reason` to `scopeRequest` meant deny, which nothing documented and no caller would guess.

  `scopeDeny` is now its own tool taking `ref`, `by`, and a required `reason`, and it is in the executor read-only allowlist. `scopeRequest` requires `files` and no longer doubles as a denial. The `commit` refusal names both paths, so whoever reads it can approve or refuse without going to the source.

#### Fixes

- Plugin test suites run under the same hermetic git env as the release cut (SQ-1250) [`d1d06d2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/d1d06d26)
  The release cut runs every plugin suite with `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` and global/system gitconfig pointed at the null device, so a fixture that leaned on ambient git config behaved one way under `npm run test:full` and another way inside `cut.mjs`. On a box with `init.defaultBranch=main` in the system gitconfig, a bare `git init` yields `main` normally and `master` under the cut. That killed two v3.330.0 cuts while the same checkout tested green, and the cut is the worst place to find out: it aborts after bumping versions, so every attempt costs a rewound release commit and two tags.

  `test:full` now builds its environment from the cut's own `suiteEnvironment()`, and CI sets the same variables, so the three run identically. A new test asserts the env is actually in effect and that `git init` in a scratch repo produces `master`, which fails loudly if the wiring is ever dropped.
- A ticket waiting on scope approval is no longer counted as closeable (SQ-1260) [`5ae0ec7`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/5ae0ec73)
  The stop-hook reminder counted every non-done ticket the session touched as something to update or close, with no exception for one blocked on a pending scope request. An executor that had filed a request and stopped to wait read that as instruction and released the ticket. A released dispatch cannot be resumed, so the work either needed hand-salvaging out of the worktree or was simply lost, and it always cost a full respawn. It hit three times in one evening, once on a complete uncommitted tree. The race makes it worse than a plain miscount: an executor waiting on approval is idle, and idle is exactly when the hook fires, so the blocked state is the one most likely to be counted.

  Tickets waiting on scope approval and submissions pending integration are now reported separately from actionable ones. The message names them as waits rather than work, and both the ordinary and escalated reminders now say to checkpoint and hold, never release.
- Committed build output pulls its own source into scope (SQ-1261) [`214ce98`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/214ce985)
  Scope already worked one way: declare `src/lib/store.ts` and the generated `lib/store.js` came along, because a generated pair says where the output lands. Going the other direction did nothing. An executor whose ticket scoped a tracked build output, or who reached one through a rebuild, had to file a scope request for the source and wait for an orchestrator to approve it, and a scope request costs a round trip while the executor sits idle.

  Worse, an executor that pushed through committed the output while its source stayed out of scope and uncommitted, so the commit's `lib/*.js` no longer matched its `src/*.ts`. The next build silently reverts it.

  `effectiveScope` now runs the generated pairs backwards too. A scoped path that is tracked, sits under a package's declared build output directory, and maps back to exactly one source under the reversed pair brings that source in with it. Ambiguous reverse matches are left alone, so a pair set that could resolve two ways still needs the request.
- Scope requests from an isolated executor no longer demand a worktree the MCP schema cannot express (SQ-1262) [`717b8c0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/717b8c0b)
  An executor running under worktree isolation called `scopeRequest` over MCP and got back `worktree_required`. There was nothing it could do about that. The tool's schema declares `ref`, `by`, `files`, and `project`, so `args.worktree` was structurally always undefined and the refusal could never be satisfied by any MCP caller. The path it needed was its own working directory, and it still had no way to hand it over.

  Under the isolation mode the skill recommends by default, that left one move: release the ticket. Which is correct, and costs a whole spawn to discover the escape hatch does not open.

  The worktree now comes from the dispatch record, which already stores it, so nothing has to be passed. Since SQ-1253 moved the marker into Sidequest's own assets directory the value is only used to confirm the caller really is isolated, and the dispatch record is a better source for that than a caller-supplied string anyway. A dispatch with no recorded worktree reports `worktree_unavailable`, which says what is actually wrong.

## v3.333.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.54.1 → 3.55.0

#### Features

- Dispatch stops calling ordinary prose a missing code symbol (SQ-1244) [`e19edd0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e19edd0d)
  Dispatch warns when a ticket names a symbol that isn't on the integration branch. It was wrong often enough to be worse than useless: it searched only the ticket's declared scope, so any real symbol living elsewhere in the repo read as missing, and it treated anything in backticks as code. Board comment ids, `ALL_CAPS` constants, attribute expressions like `fractions.Fraction`, and plain prose words got flagged, including files the ticket was filed to create. Executors took the warnings at face value and released good tickets over them.

  The check now searches the whole tree, resolves against the current branch head instead of a stale upstream ref, skips anything the ticket declares as its own output, and only treats a bare snake_case word as a symbol when the sentence actually calls it one. The warning reads as context rather than an instruction, and the executor rule now says plainly that scope limits writes but never reads, so an out-of-scope path is context, not a contradiction.

## v3.332.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.54.0 → 3.54.1

#### Fixes

- Scope-request markers stay out of your repo (SQ-1253) [`09e0294`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/09e02943)
  Asking to widen a ticket's scope used to drop a `.sidequest/scope-request-*.json` file into the executor's worktree and stage it, so it could ride along into a commit and land on main as a stray board artifact. The marker now lives in Sidequest's own asset directory. Nothing is written to your working tree and nothing is staged, so there's no `.gitignore` entry to discover after the fact.
- The high-stakes review advisory now tells you how to satisfy it (SQ-1257) [`e87cb07`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e87cb077)
  Integrating a high-stakes ticket without a review used to warn `high-stakes ticket integrated without a recorded review pass` and stop there, leaving you to guess the mechanism. The obvious guess is wrong: `verdict` belongs to the experiment loop and refuses with `no_oracle`. The advisory now names the exact way to close it, record a comment beginning `reviewed-by: <ref>`, and it resolves on its own when a completed `review-audit` ticket links to the one being integrated. The `no_oracle` refusal points at the review path too, instead of only saying no.

## v3.331.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.53.2 → 3.54.0

#### Features

- A dispatch that dies now records why, not just that it stopped (SQ-1234) [`040acf7`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/040acf76)
  A terminal dispatch recorded only that it ended. Whether the executor ran out of quota, blew the context window, lost auth, or hit a dead backend all looked identical afterwards, so nothing downstream could react to the difference. Dispatches now classify the failure into a shape and persist it, and each attempt is kept with its route, executor, and outcome so the history survives past the current one.

## v3.330.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.53.1 → 3.53.2

#### Fixes

- A failed integration verify now reports what it ran and what it printed (SQ-1248) [`84adecc`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/84adecc1)
  A refused integration returned a bare reason with no command and no output, so the only way to find out what broke was to read the board database by hand. The failure path now carries the same command, log path, and output tail the success path already reported.

## v3.329.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.53.0 → 3.53.1

#### Fixes

- Document the story decision log and scope denial (SQ-1245) [`fc79ced`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/fc79ced7)
  The Sidequest README and the getting-started page now cover what the story decision log keeps, that a clear archives instead of deleting, how to read the full history, and how an orchestrator denies a scope request.

## v3.328.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.52.0 → 3.53.0

#### Features

- Unbind the story decision log from the briefing budget (SQ-1240) [`623369a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/623369ae)
  Story logs no longer refuse an append at 4 KB. The 4 KB ceiling was always a briefing budget, and enforcing it as a storage limit meant the only escape was `story_log --clear`, which destroyed the history it was condensing. Storage now holds the full log, clearing archives instead of deleting, briefings still carry the newest entries inside 4 KB, and `sidequest story log --full` reads the whole thing.
- An orchestrator can now deny a scope request (SQ-1242) [`e2c8354`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e2c8354a)
  A pending scope request had exactly two outcomes: grant it, or throw the executor's work away. `scopeRequest` now takes a reason with no files, which denies the request, clears the pending state and the marker, and keeps the claim, the checkpoint, and the original scope intact. The reason comes back to the executor so it knows why. CLI: `sidequest scope-deny`.

#### Fixes

- Make the temp-cleanup and skill-retro CLI tests platform-independent (SQ-1241) [`ffd5e65`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ffd5e652)
  Two test fixtures assumed a POSIX filesystem and only ever ran green on one platform. They now assert the same behavior on Windows and POSIX alike.

### skill-retro 0.3.1 → 0.3.2

#### Fixes

- Make the temp-cleanup and skill-retro CLI tests platform-independent (SQ-1241) [`ffd5e65`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ffd5e652)
  Two test fixtures assumed a POSIX filesystem and only ever ran green on one platform. They now assert the same behavior on Windows and POSIX alike.

### workbench 0.76.0 → 0.76.1

#### Fixes

- Point users at the docs, loudly (SQ-1243)
  The root README and the init-workspace handover now say plainly that reading the docs matters for these plugins, and the handover names the specific page for each plugin just installed. People skip plugin docs by default, and these plugins route work to other models, write project config, and inject context on every prompt.

## v3.327.0 (2026-08-01)

### codebase-mapper 2.12.0 → 2.12.1

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.

### live-rules 2.9.0 → 2.9.1

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.

### model-gateway 0.46.2 → 0.46.3

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.

### sidequest 3.51.0 → 3.52.0

#### Features

- Re-derive the starter routing profiles around required capability instead of artifact type (SQ-1222) [`5f19f73`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/5f19f730b3122a39833a0589912593479f3f4a69)
  Starter categories were named after the thing produced, but a category only decides model and effort, so the axis that matters is what capability the work needs. Research split into a cheap lookup and a real investigation, testing became behavior-verification, ui-frontend became interaction-design-implementation, and the writing starter no longer ships a docs-writing category to projects with no docs. Existing boards migrate; the seed migration now keys on category id rather than on the old description text, which is what used to strand artifactRoots on upgrade.

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.
- Restore the README claims that the plugin contract tests pin (SQ-1229) [`70daf4b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/70daf4b4f76a)
  The README rewrite dropped three claims the suites assert on and introduced an internal identifier one of them forbids.
- Stop the compaction policy tests inheriting SIDEQUEST_COMPACTION_POLICY from the shell (SQ-1230) [`ea34114`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ea341146e3eff3b6ab84d557e60915818a3a6fa5)
  The tests spawned the hook with the developer's own environment, so on a machine with the per-project veto setting the two default-policy tests got the veto policy and failed. That made the release gate red for anyone with a legitimate local setting.

### skill-retro 0.3.0 → 0.3.1

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.

### workbench 0.75.0 → 0.76.0

#### Features

- init-workspace explains what it is doing while it runs (SQ-1220) [`661c213`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/661c21358a4bdeb02310fdc6b9a1f7449ddb7f91)
  The skill was written purely as agent instructions, so someone running it got a series of questions with no stated reason. It now orients you before the first question, gives every ask a one-line reason, says which files it writes including the one global settings exception for the compaction window, and ends Phase 5 as a handover rather than a silent stop.
- Build out the init-workspace rule templates for projects that are not codebases (SQ-1223) [`6c1572e`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6c1572e824a12f23b267e635d7689c69595df522)
  The not-a-codebase section was a three-bullet stub sitting under about ten detailed code rules, so a knowledge vault got a thinner workspace than a Python repo. It now covers voice enforcement against the project's own guideline files, per-type frontmatter conformance, dating temporal claims, handling contradictions, link hygiene, and research sourcing. Generated rule text is also told to conform to the target project's own voice rules.
- init-workspace derives categories and rules from the project instead of cloning a starter (SQ-1225) [`02c6582`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/02c6582578da792eda1510d02e78863265925550)
  Phase 0 told the agent to propose a small delta from the closest starter, which anchored it on the template and made removing an inherited category feel abnormal. The flow now enumerates what capabilities the work actually needs, requires a per-category justification and a contract, and treats the starters and rule catalogs as reference rather than a base. A generated artifact that comes out byte-identical to a template block is stated as the signal it was copied rather than derived.

#### Fixes

- Point every plugin README at the docs site and state the right install scope (SQ-1219) [`40faeb1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/40faeb1b3168c01822cc50158cc529d95330d990)
  Each plugin README now opens with a link to its guide on the docs site, and says whether it installs at user scope or project scope. Model Gateway is user scope only: its wiring writes ~/.claude/settings.json and there is no project-scoped mode.
- Treat non-codebase projects as a real project class in the init-workspace stack reference (SQ-1224) [`f6c8e90`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f6c8e903e56cbd5238ce6bbfc88356508f93fa7c)
  stack-plugins.md gave non-codebase projects two lines and used them as the leftover bucket. They now get a proper section, so a vault or a writing project gets a considered plugin set instead of whatever did not match a language.
- Restore the README claims that the plugin contract tests pin (SQ-1229) [`70daf4b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/70daf4b4f76a)
  The README rewrite dropped three claims the suites assert on and introduced an internal identifier one of them forbids.

## v3.306.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.49.0 → 3.50.0

#### Features

- Warn at dispatch when a ticket names symbols or ticket refs that contradict the repo and board (SQ-1141) [`8482435`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/84824356eee9375d398fe2cb45aaa500add711fb)

## v3.305.0 (2026-08-01)

### sidequest 3.48.0 → 3.49.0

#### Features

- Refuse prose or environment-broken verify fields at authoring time and validate them before merge (SQ-1125) [`d36c9b5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/d36c9b52f4f05af6d55f35e55ddbf8784e758e2f)
- Executors checkpoint findings to the board and request scope instead of shipping workarounds (SQ-1138) [`053e2ba`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/053e2bae5997c616797cc04b0c791b3d9313af9b)

## v3.304.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.47.1 → 3.48.0

#### Features

- A green suite's full output was 43k tokens of nothing (SQ-1129) [`1e6d5a1`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/1e6d5a1)
  Running the sidequest suite emitted 177,001 bytes across 4,788 lines. Executors run a gate several times, so a single ticket could spend well over 100k tokens ingesting TAP that says 'ok'. Two executors were killed by context exhaustion in one evening with this as the dominant cost.

  Verify discipline now redirects the full gate to a temporary log and prints only the exit status and the TAP summary counts, reading log ranges around a failure rather than dumping the file. Filtered green output is 110 bytes across 6 lines. The wrapper preserves the command's exit code, so filtering never weakens the submission gate, and a briefing can supply the wrapper with the ticket's exact command already filled in.

## v3.303.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.47.0 → 3.47.1

#### Fixes

- Contended ticket-lock writers starved the lock holder under load (SQ-1133) [`226f257`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/226f257)
  The ticket lock's wait was a busy spin on Date.now(). On a loaded machine the waiting process consumed the CPU the lock holder needed to finish its transaction, so a concurrent close could fail rather than resolving into one idempotent and one non-idempotent winner. It surfaced as an intermittent test failure that only appeared when the machine was saturated, and it failed a release gate on a commit that could not have caused it.

  Contended writers now sleep instead of spinning. The abandoned-lock threshold also moved from 5s to 30s, so a live-but-starved holder is no longer mistaken for a crashed one; a genuinely crashed holder still releases its ticket rather than wedging it forever.

  The test's failure message now reports each call's exit status, signal, stdout and stderr. It previously interpolated stderr alone, so the release log recorded a bare 'done race failed:' with nothing after it.

## v3.302.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.46.0 → 3.47.0

#### Features

- Read-only executors were locked out of every MCP but two hardcoded ones (SQ-1122) [`81a95e0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/81a95e0)
  Read-only executor agents now receive MCP tools by default (mcp__*) instead of an enumerated pair. The previous list named only the plugin-provided Playwright server, so a Playwright MCP configured directly in .mcp.json (mcp__playwright__*) was still blocked, as was every other server: Context7, chrome-devtools, a Notion or other data-source MCP. Each new one meant another hardcoded entry, and until someone noticed, executors improvised through Bash while the orchestrator invented per-ticket guardrails.

  The old list was also incoherent about its own purpose. It already granted Bash, which can modify anything, and the board's own MCP tools, which write board state. Blocking a read-only lookup while allowing Bash protected nothing. The contract is that a read-only executor does not modify the repository working tree, and MCP membership is unrelated to that.

  Boards that need to withhold a specific server can set readOnlyDeniedTools. The resolved per-board list feeds the agent-definition cache signature, so two boards with different denylists cannot collide on one cached definition.
- The pending-submission nudge fired once and never again (SQ-1123) [`815cb90`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/815cb90)
  A submitted ticket awaiting integration is the highest-value item on a board, and the Stop-hook reminder for it deduplicated on a signature of the open tickets. A submission that just sits there produces an identical signature every turn, so the nudge fired exactly once and stayed silent for every later stop. The board state that most needed escalation was precisely the one that was not changing, and recovery depended on a human noticing an idle orchestrator.

  Pending submissions now re-escalate after three consecutive stops on an unchanged board, naming the specific refs and the action to take rather than repeating the same line. The deduplication is kept for everything else, so a stable board still does not nag.

## v3.301.0 (2026-07-31)

### skill-retro 0.2.0 → 0.3.0

#### Features

- skill-retro amends an existing skill instead of only adding a new one (SQ-1130) [`3abb97b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/3abb97b24b9f3c754247ae2036085ecc0c3ecb4c)

## v3.300.0 (2026-07-31)

### model-gateway 0.43.0 → 0.44.0

#### Features

- Gateway context overflow was indistinguishable from a 32MB body cap (SQ-880) [`fbe245b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/fbe245b)
  The gateway returns HTTP 413 request_too_large when a Codex context crosses its compaction trigger, which is deliberate: that is what makes Claude Code compact and retry. But Claude Code renders any 413 of that type as 'Request too large (max 32MB). Accumulated images and attachments in the conversation pushed the request over the limit.' So an agent overflowing its own token window looked exactly like a byte-cap rejection caused by pasted screenshots, and the only thing saying otherwise was buried in errorDetails.

  The sentry message now identifies itself: 'Prompt is too long for the Codex context window; compact and retry. (<actual> tokens > <trigger> tokens)'. The status and error type are unchanged, so auto-compact still works.

  The orchestration guidance was wrong in the same way and is corrected. It told orchestrators that a 32MB launch failure was non-retryable inherited attachments from the parent and to compact the parent session. Measured wire data says otherwise: executor request bodies peaked at 1.37MB while the orchestrator peaked at 2.44MB, and there is no inherited attachment envelope. The rule now says diagnose first, and for the token signature dispatch one fresh executor with tighter scope rather than compacting the parent.

## v3.299.0 (2026-07-31)

### model-gateway 0.42.0 → 0.43.0

#### Features

- The request-body guard measures the transcript instead of the request (SQ-879) [`a014120`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a014120)
  The 32MB request-body warning read the whole transcript .jsonl and reported attachments plus 1.1x the rest. Measured against real wire data that overstated the request body by 15x to 40x: the guard reported 29-39MB on a session whose largest actual request was 2.30MB. It counted history discarded by compaction, per-record bookkeeping that never leaves the machine, and pasted images twice, and it went silent above a 36MB transcript, so it was dark on exactly the sessions that needed it. The remedy it printed, run /compact, could not move the number it reported.

  The gateway already computes the true size of every forwarded request, so it now keeps a small per-session high-water record and the hook reads that instead. The guard reflects the real body, works regardless of transcript size, and costs a sub-kilobyte read per spawn rather than a 175ms whole-file scan. The warning threshold is 24MB of the 32MB cap; the largest body ever measured in this project was 7.19MB.

### workbench 0.71.0 → 0.72.0

## v3.298.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.44.0 → 3.45.0

#### Features

- Read-only executors can't drive Playwright, and their no-write promise is false (SQ-1113) [`bd64515`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/bd64515)
  Read-only executor agents now get the Playwright MCP tools, so a visual-review ticket can drive a browser through a sanctioned tool instead of improvising one from Bash. The role note also describes the real boundary now: don't modify the repo working tree, Bash is for inspection and tests, scratch goes in the session scratchpad, no installs into the project's package.json or node_modules. It previously claimed the tools could not change files at all, which was never true with Bash in the same allowlist.

## v3.297.0 (2026-07-31)

### live-rules 2.8.0 → 2.9.0

#### Features

- live-rules migration must remove the monolith it replaces (SQ-1105) [`7f311ed`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7f311ed)
  Migrating a project from .claude/live-rules.md to the atomic .claude/live-rules/ directory now finishes the job: it writes the atomic set, loads it back, compares every rule field for field, and removes the monolith only once they match. On any mismatch it keeps both files and says why. The retired monolith was still a live fallback the loader picked up whenever the manifest failed to parse, so leaving it behind meant a stale copy could silently win later. An explicit LIVE_RULES_PATH is left alone.

## v3.296.0 (2026-07-31)

### live-rules 2.7.3 → 2.8.0

#### Features

- live-rules injection header names the legacy monolith even when atomic rules are loaded (SQ-1104) [`8f873e9`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/8f873e9)
  The injected Source line always printed .claude/live-rules.md, even when the atomic .claude/live-rules/ directory was the loader's actual source, so the header contradicted what was loaded. It now names the real source. Rules dropped from an atomic set are also surfaced by name instead of vanishing behind a bare stale flag.

## v3.295.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.43.0 → 3.44.0

#### Features

- State resolved worktree identity in dispatch briefings (SQ-1091) [`2808252`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2808252)
  Executors opened by probing for where they were: git rev-parse --git-dir with --git-common-dir and status --short ran 98 times across 7 distinct executor types in four days, 230 runs of that family costing 22.9 minutes, for information dispatch already held when it wrote the briefing. The briefing now states the resolved worktree path, git-dir, and whether the checkout is linked or shared.

#### Fixes

- Retire the dead dev branch from CI and release tooling (SQ-1096) [`f15b6e0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f15b6e03f020ef9de699a5a8d475d6c285674c03)
  test.yml now runs on main pushes instead of the dead dev branch, which had left main pushes with no test coverage. cut.mjs drops the stale restore-the-invariant instruction and its unused integration-branch flag; release-guard no longer triggers on dev.

## v3.294.0 (2026-07-31)

### codebase-mapper 2.11.3 → 2.12.0

#### Features

- Inject the codebase map into work subagents at SubagentStart (SQ-1089) [`6216880`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6216880)
  Subagents started with no map and re-read it by hand: 851 orienting reads costing ~134 min and ~4.44M fresh tokens across 58 transcripts in four days, with modules.md itself among the most re-read files. The map is now injected at SubagentStart, matcher-scoped to work-executing agent types so cheap recon agents do not pay for context they will not use. Also stops the test suite inheriting CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, which had been silently pointing every temp-fixture test at the real repo whenever the variable was set.

### sidequest 3.42.4 → 3.43.0

#### Features

- Preload verify discipline into every dispatched executor (SQ-1090) [`4a68a9a`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/4a68a9a)
  Test and check commands were 284.5 of the 341 minutes of shell wall clock measured over four days, 566 of 693 runs by subagents, with test:full averaging 51.3s against 21.5s for a scoped run. A new verify-discipline skill is preloaded through the subagent skills: frontmatter field, which injects full skill content at startup and is the only route that reaches read-only executors, whose tool list omits Skill.

### skill-retro 0.1.0 → 0.2.0

#### Features

- Rank findings by elapsed time, not only occurrence count (SQ-1092) [`e52742b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e52742b)
  Ranking by count alone could not answer which repeated work actually costs anything: npm ci looked significant at 193 runs but only 16.9 minutes, while the verify loop was 284.5. Elapsed time now flows through from the transcript records and appears alongside occurrence count in the ranked table and per-finding detail.

#### Fixes

- Report an unavailable replay shell instead of calling the script broken (SQ-1093) [`f075bfb`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f075bfb)
  Salvage replay hardcoded bash -lc. Under cmd.exe, where bash is not on PATH, the spawn failure was reported as nonzero-exit, the same status a genuinely broken script gets, so a working salvaged script was labelled broken. An unavailable shell is now a distinct status. Present in 0.1.0 and hidden because CI runs on Linux and local runs use Git Bash.

## v3.293.0 (2026-07-31)

### skill-retro 0.0.0 → 0.1.0

#### Features

- Add skill-retro: mine transcripts for repeated work and route it to durable fixes (SQ-1088) [`19dc097`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/19dc09735f83a442fc5e41e42224004cab2c8006)
  Finds the work that keeps getting redone across recent sessions and proposes where each fix belongs: a skill, a bundled script, a live rule, a memory entry, a map edit, or nothing. It reads subagent transcripts too, which is where most of the work in an orchestrated repo actually happens, and the actor decides the route: a skill never reaches an executor, so repetition by executors goes to a script or a rule instead. Transcripts are streamed by a bundled CLI and never loaded into context. Workbench retro now points at it for anything spanning more than the current session.

### model-gateway 0.41.0 → 0.42.0

#### Features

- Picking a wiring mode now actually wires it (SQ-1085) [`ecb7a0e`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ecb7a0ec0087636c988037476b6d45b4d4fde399)
  env --mode global recorded a preference and wrote nothing, so a machine could sit in global mode with unwired user settings and every project outside an explicitly-wired repo silently had no gateway models. doctor printed that state as a neutral line among healthy ones. Selecting a mode now completes the wiring, doctor treats an unwired active scope as a failure with the repair command and a nonzero exit, and it also names the case where a project env block masks global wiring.

## v3.291.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.42.3 → 3.42.4

#### Fixes

- Stop hook stops nagging about tickets a live executor is working (SQ-1083) [`f790c9c`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/f790c9c6b602754aa30aae82788444f3ffd572ca)
  The board reconciliation reminder counted every ticket this session dispatched as debt, so a normal parallel wave nagged for its whole duration in one bucket or the other: 'N tickets in doing' while executors worked, 'N tickets still open' before they claimed. It now keys on dispatch liveness instead of status. A live dispatch is never debt. A dispatch that went terminal without a submission still is, which is the stranded-executor case the reminder is actually for.
- Executors are told to run gates in the foreground (SQ-1084) [`7593b20`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7593b2062ace6c93175e1045aa3b69ba828d9c2c)
  Two executors backgrounded their gate runs behind monitors of processes that were never started, then slept forever holding their claims while the board read healthy. Every dispatched executor prompt now carries the rule: foreground with a bounded timeout, never sleep on a monitor for your own work, and if a run must be backgrounded, confirm it started and poll in a bounded loop that fails loud.

## v3.290.0 (2026-07-31)

### sidequest 3.42.2 → 3.42.3

#### Fixes

- Do not reclaim a claim while its verify is still running (SQ-1082) [`caf24ba`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/caf24baf68867fd9a7948092e7dc9cf685461b07)
  An executor blocked on a long verify looked identical to a dead one, so its claim could be swept out from under it and its commit refused. Claims now carry a verification marker, pulse reports whether a claim is verifying, and a claim is not reclaimable while that marker is live. An uncompleted marker still releases at the existing abandon backstop, so a crashed executor cannot pin a claim forever.

## v3.289.0 (2026-07-30)

### sidequest 3.42.1 → 3.42.2

#### Fixes

- Warn about build output, read-only browser reviews, and unrunnable verify commands (SQ-1081) [`6c5ec3b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/6c5ec3bf7bf43d040e24b969871eb8dae8b34779)
  Filing a ticket now warns when its scope changes source for a package whose build output is tracked but left out of scope, when a read-only ticket asks for browser or visual review work an executor with no write tool cannot do, and when a recorded verify command would not run from the directory it names. Adds short guidance that one ticket per wave owns a content-hashed build, and that a different test failing each run points at the runner rather than the tests.

## v3.288.0 (2026-07-30)

### sidequest 3.42.0 → 3.42.1

#### Fixes

- Dashboard tour and board menu follow-ups (SQ-1079) [`5e4daad`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/5e4daad7bbe9326c22e0062e3b75a03918351212)
  The tour opens the most illustrative ticket rather than the first (SQ-1074), and ends by showing how to archive or delete a board, noting it comes back when an agent starts work there again (SQ-1079). Right-clicking a board opens its menu at the pointer, flipped and clamped to stay on screen (SQ-1078), and that menu now shows Archive and Delete for active boards instead of misreading an archived-ticket count as an archived board (SQ-1060).
- Stabilize the full test runner (SQ-1080) [`e7c4fe0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e7c4fe0d56317df1fc86f7896f2399dcc611c643)
  The runner handed every test file to Node's default 32-way concurrency while several of those files spawn their own Git, SQLite, dashboard and hook subprocesses, so unrelated tests failed at random under the load. It now sorts the file list and caps test-file concurrency at 4.

## v3.287.0 (2026-07-30)

  Catalog entries now carry a provider slug, Grok models are advertised alongside Codex, and a per-provider readiness map replaces the codex-only key (codexReadiness still mirrored for older readers).

### sidequest 3.41.0 → 3.42.0

#### Features

- Provider-generic dispatch readiness (SQ-1071) [`2b2a720`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2b2a72088d8229dafcc39b8966553acf037d5a9b)
  Dispatch readiness is no longer codex-only: the route's model resolves to its catalog provider and that provider's readiness is checked, refusing loudly on unknown or unready backends (Grok included). Schema 2/3 catalogs keep today's behavior.
- Interactive first-run tour for the dashboard (US-35) [`ef198e7`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/ef198e70e50a213aa4a4e439bbeb74f7f4ddc057)
  Auto-starts once on a first visit and walks the board as read-first orientation: what each surface is and where to look, since agents file most tickets and people are mostly reading. Spotlights each target, opens a real ticket to show the comment thread, and remembers where you stopped. Replay it from Settings under Appearance, or press ?.

#### Fixes

- Cross-board Model routing settings table (SQ-1059) [`7a6ead9`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7a6ead9)
  Replaced the single-board 'Routing enabled' toggle in Settings with a cross-board table (one row per board, per-row checkbox, Check all/Uncheck all).

### workbench 0.70.2 → 0.70.3

#### Fixes

- init-workspace wires the gateway mode it asks about, global now recommended (SQ-1061) [`9b03dfa`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/9b03dfa37b443ae7a3cf305a96f455e7e29420b8)
  init-workspace now recommends global gateway wiring (per-project wiring never reaches executor worktrees), runs env --write-project immediately when per-project is still chosen, and reports wiring status in the wrap-up. Docs prose updated to match.

## v3.285.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.40.2 → 3.40.3

#### Fixes

- Publishing from a scratch worktree inside the OS temp dir fails Sidequest tests (SQ-891) [`3bc6e7f`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/3bc6e7f)
  Make the outside-temp cleanup fixture path-independent so release suites pass from clean scratch worktrees under the OS temp directory.
- Helper routing must prefer board categories before generic fallback (SQ-1045) [`2adc155`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2adc155)
  Require category-first board routing, allow safeguarded generic helpers only when no category applies, and route audit/review prompts through review-audit.
- Apply inline-safe gate before ticketing one-line housekeeping (SQ-1046) [`2389d92`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2389d92)
  Run the inline-safe check before solo-fit and ticket filing; exact one-line .gitignore housekeeping now stays inline.

## v3.284.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.40.1 → 3.40.2

#### Fixes

- Mixed scope requests stay coherent through approval (SQ-1020) [`7e64ec2`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7e64ec2d1a4808b19a9c216efae4710aa11bad7c)
  A request mixing already-effective and pending paths reports exactly which paths need approval, keeps the full intended commit scope after approval, and can no longer produce a partial commit of only the pre-approved subset.

## v3.283.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.40.0 → 3.40.1

#### Fixes

- Files-only ticket updates no longer emit stale unknown-ref warnings (SQ-1018) [`fb4387e`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/fb4387ecc03becef7fbee9d4ee40a7b82c4c46b9)
  Reference warnings are derived only from the fields an update actually changed, so approving scope no longer resurfaces unknown refs quoted in older ticket text.

## v3.282.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.39.1 → 3.40.0

#### Features

- Dispatch refuses GPT-routed tickets when Codex is down (SQ-1025) [`c3c66b8`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/c3c66b8bec14ed1072c238616fe2a83cee8f234c)
  prepareDispatch requires live provider readiness before preparing a token: a dead Codex backend refuses the dispatch with recovery steps, same-provider fallback records fallbackReason, and silent cross-provider substitution to a Claude model is no longer possible.

## v3.281.0 (2026-07-29)

### workbench 0.70.1 → 0.70.2

#### Fixes

- Updater migrates installed codex-gateway after the rename (SQ-1022) [`dd430c5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/dd430c56ed29731e16586919e81fe0e8d7e782c0)
  update-toolshed recognizes a recorded codex-gateway install, migrates it to model-gateway at the same scope, and documents the manual path.

## v3.280.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.39.0 → 3.39.1

#### Fixes

- Stop-time board reminder now reaches the agent (SQ-1031) [`8f22a2d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/8f22a2d04c17064e76d273e80a9451720b6ab4ab)
  The reconciliation reminder emits Stop additionalContext the model acts on, guarded by stop_hook_active and a per-state ceiling, alongside the user-visible line.
- Helpers no longer cite the ticket's own strings as evidence (SQ-1032) [`1b77c02`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/1b77c024faa9bb980556bf06a0a7d9d8e9cd3135)
  Helper searches resolving into the current session's own transcripts are reported as self-reference, and executor guidance names the quoted-evidence trap.

## v3.279.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.8 → 3.39.0

#### Features

- Integrate runs the recorded verify command and refuses done on failure (SQ-1035) [`46c7191`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/46c7191d65dded23b5f7e3e92d269ea6367749d3)
  Integration now machine-checks the submission's verify command against the delivered result: failure or timeout delivers but refuses done with exit code and output tail; skipping requires an explicit recorded flag.

## v3.278.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.7 → 3.38.8

#### Fixes

- Dispatch worktrees honor integrationBranch (SQ-1034) [`4e68f71`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/4e68f71e41fe5a9e0945dacbba78f59843ade144)
  An explicit integrationBranch now sets the executor worktree base and the delivery target; an unresolvable branch refuses the dispatch with the ref named instead of silently substituting the default base.

## v3.277.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.6 → 3.38.7

#### Fixes

- Shared-tree gate no longer blocks done over unrelated dirty files (SQ-1033) [`a3b276b`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/a3b276ba731085dd40938854bcd93b9f7ade06af)
  The done-path dirty check is scoped to the ticket's own files; bystander changes elsewhere in a shared checkout no longer strand finished, committed work in doing.

## v3.276.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.5 → 3.38.6

#### Fixes

- Terminal executors cannot write after resurrection (SQ-1030) [`172817d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/172817dcc7057d3213ed3f9a0a42095db046aace)
  The worktree-isolation guard used to drop its record on submit/release, so a resumed executor fell through to the shared checkout. It now fails closed: a terminal ticket, a missing dispatch record, or a cross-project target all refuse the write.

## v3.275.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.4 → 3.38.5

#### Fixes

- Constrain executor sub-delegation (SQ-1029) [`661f473`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/661f473538e358f1079caa53dec2bee380294d17)
  Executor helper spawns are limited to an allowlist, forced into the background so they stay steerable, denied a default model, and no longer isolated into a worktree that cannot see the parent's work.

## v3.274.0 (2026-07-29)

### model-gateway 0.39.0 → 0.40.0

#### Features

- Gateway: one Codex readiness predicate shared by ensure, doctor, and consumers (SQ-1024) [`d636ec5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/d636ec5d2d554403ae48ac22b941ddad1eb45939)
  Adds an event-driven readiness signal covering binary, proxy, auth, shim, serving version, and a retained upstream-blocked state; ensure and doctor now read one predicate instead of re-deriving liveness.

## v3.273.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.3 → 3.38.4

#### Fixes

- Sidequest blocks sub-delegation from generic subagents (SQ-1027) [`2ce5843`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2ce5843c92664e6f64e5dc203d216ead06f9fa24)
  The generic-Agent guard now keys on spawn depth, so an already-running subagent can sub-delegate; the main-loop deny is unchanged.

## v3.272.0 (2026-07-29)

### model-gateway 0.38.1 → 0.39.0

#### Features

- Streamline gateway model IDs (SQ-1004) [`e675027`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e675027)
  Advertises claude-gpt-* and claude-grok-4.5 while preserving legacy IDs and existing Sidequest catalog slugs.

### sidequest 3.38.2 → 3.38.3

#### Fixes

- Streamline gateway model IDs (SQ-1004) [`e675027`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e675027)
  Advertises claude-gpt-* and claude-grok-4.5 while preserving legacy IDs and existing Sidequest catalog slugs.

### workbench 0.70.0 → 0.70.1

  Advertises claude-gpt-* and claude-grok-4.5 while preserving legacy IDs and existing Sidequest catalog slugs.

## v3.271.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.1 → 3.38.2

#### Fixes

- Warn when a write-scope ticket is filed with no declared files (SQ-1009) [`8ae8f5d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/8ae8f5d757b6f1bc7e07cb289c3c9a9a67378a29)

- Give tickets a plan document: large storage, on-demand read, never inlined (SQ-1015) [`2dc8ae5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2dc8ae5ea45bb7221f6e6e0a3372f6bdc6378914)
- Dispatch must refuse before spawning when the target project has no Sidequest MCP install (SQ-1017) [`641ceb3`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/641ceb36600bf92c32ed127b2667d3ff5b195c78)

## v3.270.0 (2026-07-29)

### sidequest 3.38.0 → 3.38.1

#### Fixes

- Executor stops after Monitor timeout while its required background job keeps running (SQ-1016) [`41459b5`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/41459b5b2504e302db3b917c51f874bc3e0722d4)

## v3.269.0 (2026-07-28)

### sidequest 3.37.1 → 3.38.0

#### Features

- Partial submissions can no longer report themselves ready for integration (SQ-1008) [`0b2605d`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/0b2605d3d81e9f9b39fbcc47114af512c20bb8ea)

#### Fixes

- Hook byte-budget tests no longer measure the repo's own path (SQ-1011) [`7c1bdc0`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/7c1bdc0c23b515d087366b40d4c1755e67a522c9)
- The pinned test plugin root is per-checkout, so concurrent worktrees stop sharing one junction (SQ-1013) [`e98b876`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/e98b876ef10210a99e83cf22f60f5e1683b6a401)

## v3.268.0 (2026-07-28)

### model-gateway 0.38.0 → 0.38.1

#### Fixes

- Docs moved to the model-gateway name, with redirects for the old slugs (SQ-1002) [`2cc5824`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/2cc5824c3b69835343df94d285949014b7ce47c7)
- The CLI no longer tells users to run a slash command that was renamed away (SQ-1007) [`d021499`](https://github.com/Eigenwise/eigenwise-toolshed/commit/d0214990710a76e0844bc3d38e6f30e06f133edd)

## v3.267.0 (2026-07-28)
