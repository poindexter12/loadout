# quartermaster

Quartermaster helps with the setup work that tends to get repeated. It looks at a project and at bounded summaries of recent Claude Code sessions, asks what would help, and proposes one change at a time. Setup, resupply, updates, and health checks are separate workflows, and every install, file edit, or settings change waits for your approval.

It can set up a new or existing workspace, keep active Loadout installs current, check their health, and suggest a missing skill, rule, measurement, permission, or plugin after real work has accumulated. A later pass checks whether an accepted change helped. Unused or ineffective changes can be rolled back.

When setup wires Model Gateway or Sidequest routing, it can also offer the optional `325000` `autoCompactWindow` setting for a consistent Codex compaction point. This is a consistency choice, not a prerequisite. Setup asks before writing it, and an existing user or project value is reported and preserved.

## Install

Quartermaster works at user, project, or local scope. Install it at the scope you want, for example:

```text
/plugin marketplace add poindexter12/loadout
/plugin install quartermaster@loadout --scope project
```

Project scope is the recommended starting point when the setup belongs to one repository. User scope makes its skills available in every project. Local scope keeps the install out of shared settings.

After installing, run `/reload-plugins` or start a new Claude Code session. Then use `/quartermaster:setup` in a project, or `/quartermaster:resupply` after some real sessions.

## How it works

Quartermaster has hooks for setup hints, local tallies, freshness notices, and resupply offers. The hooks do not call a model for the mining pass. The plugin also ships skills for `setup`, `resupply`, `update-loadout`, and `loadout-doctor`.

- **Setup** assesses one project, mines a cross-project history summary, asks a short interview, and proposes a project baseline. The Loadout pieces remain independent and opt in separately.
- **Resupply** mines the current project by default after you approve a round. It ranks missing measurements, manual work, re-derived knowledge, underperforming capabilities, and setup friction, then asks for approval for each finding.
- **Update** runs the requested updater for active Loadout registry installs, at their recorded user, project, or local scope and project path. It does not update third-party marketplaces.
- **Doctor** is read-only. It checks installed versions, freshness, workspace wiring, and any installed Observability or Model Gateway health it can inspect.

The updater and the freshness hooks have different jobs. `/quartermaster:update-loadout` changes installs when you request it. Freshness hooks report cached availability or loaded-version mismatches and point to the updater; they do not install or restart anything. Marketplace auto-update is optional and must be enabled for the Loadout marketplace in Claude Code. An open session still needs `/reload-plugins` after plugin code changes. Process-level gateway wiring or model discovery may need a new Claude Code process.

## Privacy and the history summary

Quartermaster's local script reads Claude Code transcript files from the machine and emits a bounded JSON aggregate. The active model sees that aggregate when the setup or resupply skill reads it. Raw transcript files are not loaded into model context, and the skills are explicitly forbidden from opening them. The scripts make no network calls for this catalog and mining flow.

The aggregate is more than counts. It can include:

- a clipped session title, up to 120 characters;
- the first real user prompt, up to 240 characters;
- explicit goal conditions, whether each goal was met, and bounded goal samples;
- the two directory segments nearest touched files, with scratch and opaque paths removed;
- counts for prompts, tool calls, errors, denials, interrupts, and corrections;
- repeated command names, plugin, skill, and MCP attribution, and fetched hostnames; and
- short clipped correction or denial evidence, up to 300 characters per quote.

Setup explicitly requests the all-projects aggregate. Resupply reads the current project by default and only uses `--all-projects` for a global pass. The state directory stores local tallies and the decision ledger, not raw conversation transcripts.

## The setup handoff

Setup installs the approved plugins and writes the approved workspace files. It then stops at the plugin reload boundary. Reload plugins or restart Claude Code when the change affects the process environment, tell Claude `continue`, and let setup verify the result after that boundary. Do not treat an installed plugin as loaded in the current process until the reload or restart has happened.

## CLI

```text
node bin/quartermaster.js mine [--project <path>] [--days 30] [--sessions 40] [--all-projects]
node bin/quartermaster.js status [--project <path>]
node bin/quartermaster.js catalog [--query <terms>] [--installed]
node bin/quartermaster.js decisions list
node bin/quartermaster.js decisions add --title <t> --fingerprint <f> --status applied|rejected ...
node bin/quartermaster.js verify [--project <path>]
node bin/quartermaster.js mark-resupply [--project <path>]
node bin/quartermaster.js decline-resupply [--project <path>]
node bin/quartermaster.js allowlist [--project <path>] [--days 30] [--sessions 40] [--blocked]
node bin/quartermaster.js enable-auto-allowlist --project <path>
```

Everything prints JSON. Node standard library only, no dependencies, cross-platform.

## Configuration

Environment variables are optional:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QUARTERMASTER_MIN_SESSIONS` | 4 | Unreviewed sessions before a nudge |
| `QUARTERMASTER_MIN_FRICTION` | 6 | Friction events before a nudge |
| `QUARTERMASTER_NUDGE_HOURS` | 24 | Cooldown between SessionStart nudges and after a resupply pass |
| `QUARTERMASTER_OFFER_HOURS` | 24 | Cross-session cooldown between Stop-time offers |
| `QUARTERMASTER_STATE_DIR` | `~/.claude/quartermaster-state` | Where tallies and the decision ledger live |
