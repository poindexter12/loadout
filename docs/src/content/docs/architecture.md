## Maintainer overview

Loadout is a marketplace of independent Claude Code plugins. Each plugin owns its setup, hooks, skills, and local state. The plugins cooperate through small, explicit boundaries rather than importing one another's implementation.

```

- Quartermaster owns the cross-plugin setup plan for new and existing projects, updates Loadout plugins, and checks workspace health.
- Codebase Mapper and Live Rules add project context without requiring the other plugins.
- Observability records selected metadata locally. Its observer, collector, and dashboard stay on loopback.
- Sidequest owns tickets, stories, routing, dispatch, and executor evidence.
- Model Gateway owns the optional model-proxy boundary. Claude models can keep their normal API path.

See [modular Loadout architecture](./modular-architecture/) for the registry and routing boundaries. User-facing installation and daily use belong in the [plugin guides](../getting-started/), not here.
