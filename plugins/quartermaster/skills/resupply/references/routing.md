# Where each kind of finding lands

One finding, one destination. Check project code and commands, native platform features, the
standard library, and installed dependencies, plugins, and skills before proposing new machinery.
Reuse an adequate capability; extend it only for a demonstrated gap. If a change is still needed,
choose the smallest destination that fits.

Routing is not permission to apply a change. A round needs current user approval or explicit standing
permission before mining. Each exact change needs per-item approval unless explicit standing
permission covers that class; round approval does not authorize unrelated edits.

This orders *destinations*, not findings. A finding's rank in what you propose comes from how well
the evidence carries it, so a measurement you inferred from one session title still lands below a
denial pattern you can count, even though its destination sits at the top of this list.

## 1. Measurement skill (an instrument)

For a standard the user cares about that nothing can currently check: correctness, reliability,
performance, coverage, cost. This sits at the top because an unverifiable goal cannot be closed,
and because no friction counter will ever surface it.

- Start with existing tests, benchmarks, linters, validation scripts, and native tooling. Record the
  command and its limitations. Extend one before writing a second check of the same property.
- Only when a recurring measurement needs a skill, build it with skill-creator and keep its scripts
  beside it. A new skill is not the default response to a claim that needs checking.
- Scope it to one question with a defensible answer. "Does the output match the reference on the
  real corpus" is an instrument; "is the pipeline good" is not.
- This is not only a code move. A standard that cannot be checked shows up anywhere: whether a
  document still covers what it claims, whether an export matches its source, whether deployed
  config matches the repo, whether a dataset has the rows it should. The instrument differs; the
  reasoning does not.
- Have it report its own weaknesses next to its numbers: what the sample excludes, which
  population it actually measured, what it cannot separate. An instrument that names its blind
  spot can be trusted; one that hides it produces confident wrong conclusions.
- Check `.claude/skills/` and `catalog --installed` for an existing measurement workflow.
- Fingerprint: `skill:<name>`.

## 2. Plugin install

For a capability gap an existing plugin already covers: work done by hand that someone has
packaged.

- Search: `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" catalog --query "<terms>"`. Results
  come from the official catalog cache (with install counts) plus every marketplace manifest on
  this machine. Empty results with a plausible need: try different terms before concluding nothing
  fits.
- Cost check before proposing: `claude plugin details <name>@<marketplace>` shows components and
  projected token cost. A plugin whose always-on cost outweighs what it saves is a bad trade; say
  so.
- Apply: `claude plugin install <name>@<marketplace> --scope project`. New hooks and MCP servers
  take effect on the next session.
- Fingerprint: `plugin-install:<name>`.

## 3. New skill (a workflow)

For a multi-step workflow the user keeps performing by hand with no plugin match. Build it with
skill-creator; a hand-rolled SKILL.md tends to capture the one example in front of you and
under-trigger later. Fingerprint: `skill:<name>`.

## 4. Skill improvement

For an existing skill that misfires, under-triggers, or needs manual correction. Route through
skill-creator, which explicitly supports modifying and improving existing skills and optimizing
their trigger descriptions. Show the exact diff for approval, like every other finding. Prefer
improving the existing skill over building a parallel new skill from the same evidence.
Fingerprint: `skill-improve:<name>`.

## 5. Project knowledge

For facts and layout that keep being re-derived: repeated exploration of the same area, the same
question re-answered across sessions.

- If codebase-mapper is installed, the fix is a map doc under `.claude/.codebase-info/` via its
  `update-codebase-map` skill; the index is injected at session start, so the knowledge arrives
  before anyone looks for it.
- Otherwise a short section in the project's `CLAUDE.md`.
- Durable decisions and constraints belong here too, not in a rule. Rules govern behavior;
  knowledge answers questions.
- Fingerprint: `knowledge:<area-slug>`.

## 6. MCP server

Only when no plugin wraps the capability. Search the registry:
`https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=<terms>` (WebFetch, JSON). Apply with
`claude mcp add --scope project <name> ...` per the server's own instructions. This writes the repo's
`.mcp.json`, so the server lands only in the project that asked for it. The CLI defaults to user scope
if no `--scope` flag is passed.
Fingerprint: `mcp:<name>`.

## 7. Rule (live-rules or CLAUDE.md)

For repeated corrections on one theme, conventions, and "stop doing X" findings.

- If the live-rules plugin is installed (check `catalog --installed` for `live-rules@`), use its
  add-rule skill: rules inject when they first apply (keyword, glob, or dir scoped), and again when
  their path/content hash changes. Unchanged rules do not repeat on every prompt or edit within a
  tracked session. Prefer it.
- Else: project conventions go in the project's `CLAUDE.md`; the user's personal preferences
  (voice, workflow, cross-project habits) go in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Keep the added rule to a few
  lines, in the file's existing style, and show the exact diff first.
- Fingerprint: `rule:<theme-slug>`.

## 8. Permission rule

For `permission-rule` denials that keep hitting the same safe pattern.

- Target file: project `.claude/settings.json`, key `permissions.allow`, array of rule strings like
  `Bash(npm test:*)` or `Read(src/**)`. Global patterns go in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- Show the exact rule strings and which denied calls they would have allowed. Never propose a
  blanket allow (`Bash(*)`); scope to the observed pattern.
- `user-rejected` denials belong in a rule about not doing the thing, not on the allowlist: the user
  said no to the action itself, so allowing it is the opposite of what they asked for.
- Fingerprint: `permission:<tool>:<pattern>`.

## 9. Plugin disable / uninstall

For installed plugins with no recorded activity across a real window (20+ sessions), after
checking the plugin is not hook-only or context-injection-only.

- Apply: `claude plugin disable <name>@<marketplace>` (reversible; prefer over uninstall).
- Fingerprint: `disable:<name>`.

## 10. No destination

Some expense is situational: a genuinely hard problem, an experiment, a one-off bad day. Naming it
and moving on beats inventing a rule for it. Not every finding deserves an action, and a pass that
proposes nothing is a real outcome.
