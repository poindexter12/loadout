// Claude Code keys its LSP diagnostics registry per SESSION, not per agent (claude.exe 2.1.233: the pending
// registry is a WeakMap on session.root, and whichever agent next holds write tools drains it), so a file an
// executor opens in its own worktree publishes errors into the orchestrator's context. There is no interception
// seam: no setting turns it off, and a hook cannot shape an attachment. Telling the receiving agent which paths
// are not its own is the only lever, and the board is the only thing that knows which of them are in flight
// (SQ-1957, SQ-1420).
//
// A swept worktree keeps producing pushes for minutes after its directory is gone, which is the worst case
// because those diagnostics can never be true, so board records are kept past the directory here on purpose.
// They are bounded: an hours-old ended run is not still publishing, and naming it forever would make this noise.
