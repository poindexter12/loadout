# Quartermaster resupply

One question drives this skill: **what is this workspace short of that would make the user's work
easier?** Then get that one thing, with their approval.

A local script does the mining and hands you a bounded aggregate. It reads transcript files on the
machine and does not send raw transcripts over the network. The resupply skill reads the aggregate,
so the active model can see its bounded fields: counts, clipped session titles and opening asks,
explicit goals and status, nearby project path segments, repeated commands, attribution, fetched
hostnames, and short evidence quotes. Raw transcripts are never loaded into model context, and the
skill must not open them.

## Why capability and not friction

The obvious way to do this is to hunt for what went wrong: denials, corrections, interrupts,
commands retyped by hand. That is worth doing, and it is the last thing on the list here, because
**removing friction returns the user to par while adding capability moves par.**

The improvements that matter most tend to leave no friction trace at all. When someone needs a
measurement that does not exist yet, nothing errors, nothing gets denied, nobody gets corrected,
and it happens exactly once, so every repetition threshold misses it. A pass that only counts pain
is structurally blind to the most valuable thing it could find.

So lead with what the user was trying to do, and treat the friction counts as one input to that
question rather than the question itself.

## Process

Before mining or starting the round, require current user approval or explicit standing permission
for these rounds. An explicit `/quartermaster:resupply` invocation requests a round; a seed, hook
nudge, or natural pause is only a reason to offer one. Round approval does not authorize unrelated
edits. Apply a recommendation only after showing its exact change and receiving per-item approval,
unless explicit standing permission covers that exact class of change.

If the user declines a SessionStart nudge or Stop-time offer before the round starts, record that whole-round decline, then stop. Run:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" decline-resupply --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
```

It resets the evidence window, so another offer waits for new sessions or friction to accumulate.

### 1. Mine

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" mine --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
```

Default window is 30 days / 40 sessions. Add `--all-projects` only if the user asks for a global
pass (much slower). Everything below reads from this one output.

### 2. Read what the work was for

The aggregate tells you this directly, so do not open with an interview. Each entry in `sessions`
carries `title` (the session's own one-line summary), `openingAsk` (its first real prompt), `goal`
(an explicit `/goal` with whether it was ever `met`), and `humanDriven`. `purpose.goals` totals the
goals set and met, and `purpose.areasTop` shows which parts of the tree the work landed in.

Weigh them like this:

- **An explicit `goal` is the strongest signal**, because it is the user stating a standard in their
  own words. It is also the rarest by a wide margin, so its absence means nothing at all.
- **`title` and `openingAsk` carry most sessions.** They agree more often than not; where they
  diverge, the title reflects where the work went and the opening ask reflects what was wanted.
- **Rank by effort, never by count.** Sort `sessions` by `toolCalls` and `minutes`. Ten one-prompt
  sessions are not ten times more important than the marathon that actually moved the work.
- **Ignore `humanDriven: false` sessions when reading purpose.** Those are hook- or
  harness-spawned. Their titles state that machinery's job, and there are often far more of them
  than real sessions, so counting titles without this filter reports the automation back to the
  user as their own goal.
- **A session with hundreds of prompts and a span of days is a container, not a task.** It was
  resumed repeatedly, and its title describes only its opening subject. For those, `goal`,
  `areasTop`, and the top commands say far more about purpose than the title does.

Then state your read in one or two lines and ask them to correct it, rather than asking them to
explain themselves from scratch: "the last three weeks look like they went into the ingest path and
its tests, with an open goal about it not dropping rows. Is that still what matters?" Say the
invitation out loud, in a sentence. A read delivered as settled fact is something they have to argue
with; the same read offered for correction costs them one line either way. Only fall back to a real
question when the signals are genuinely thin or contradictory.

Two goal shapes matter, because they need different things:

- **A task goal** names something to finish: ship the feature, migrate the store, cut the build
  time. Progress on it is visible on its own.
- **A standard goal** names a property that must hold: make it reliable, make sure the output is
  correct, make it fast enough. Progress is invisible without a way to measure it, which puts step
  4a first.

**An unmet goal is the single best lead in the whole aggregate.** `purpose.goals` reporting a goal
set and never met, especially one restated across sessions, means the user asked for something and
the workspace could not deliver it. Start there.

### 3. Score the last round

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" verify --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
```

Open with one line per earlier decision that has a verdict. Ask two things of each: is it being
used (`attribution`), and did what it targeted actually get cheaper. Name the three verdicts out
loud: **keep** when it is used and helping, **improve** when it is used but underperforming, and
**roll back** when it is unused or making no difference. Being honest about a recommendation that
did not work is what makes the next one credible.

### 4. Find the gaps

Five questions, in value order. Spend your attention at the top. This is the order to look in, not
the order to propose in: step 6 ranks what you actually find.

#### 4a. Is there something the user cannot measure?

Trace how the claimed property is currently checked before declaring an instrument missing. Look
first at project tests and commands, native platform features, the standard library, and installed
dependencies, plugins, and skills. Reuse an adequate check or propose a small extension to one.
Only propose a new instrument when that investigation shows an actual gap; an unverifiable goal
needs evidence, not necessarily another tool.

Tells, none of which appear as friction:

- A goal set and never met, or restated across several sessions.
- Long stretches of effort on something whose success criterion is a judgement call.
- A property asserted rather than demonstrated: it "should be" correct, fast enough, safe.
- The same question reopened across sessions with a different answer each time.

Those tells are not equally strong, and the difference decides where the finding ranks. A goal
restated across sessions and never met, a check re-improvised dozens of times, one question answered
two different ways: that is the aggregate telling you the instrument is missing. A single session
title plus a habit is you inferring it. Raise either one, but only the attested kind outranks a cheap
fix you are certain about.

Propose the smallest reproducible check that answers the question. Use an existing test, benchmark,
validation command, or script when it fits; package a measurement as a skill only when a recurring
workflow needs that form. This holds outside code too: document coverage, export fidelity, or
agreement between configuration and deployment can often be checked with existing tools.

Have the instrument state its own limits when you propose it. A measurement built on whatever data
was available usually carries a bias (a sample that only includes successes, a population that is
not the real one), and one that names its blind spot can be trusted where one that hides it is
worse than nothing.

When nothing in the window states a standard at all, the honest answer is usually that there is
nothing to build here. A project shipping small changes against a check that already works does not
need an instrument invented for it, and proposing one anyway spends the user's attention on your
guess instead of their evidence.

#### 4b. What is being done by hand that the workspace should own?

Repeated command sequences, hand-rolled scripts written more than once, the same multi-step chore
across sessions. Check project scripts and native tooling before suggesting an install. If those
cannot cover the workflow, prefer an existing plugin or skill over new instructions in a rule.

Search before building anything:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" catalog --query "<terms>"
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" catalog --installed
```

Then list what the project already has (`.claude/skills/`, `.claude/commands/`). A surprising share
of what feels missing is already installed under a name nobody thought of, and what is genuinely
missing turns into a better skill when it reuses what is there.

#### 4c'. What exists but underperforms?

Improve the capability already serving this work before proposing a parallel new one. Look for a
skill in `attribution` with corrections or interrupts clustered around its use; an installed skill
absent from attribution even though sessions did what its description covers, which points to an
under-triggering description; an instrument whose numbers were doubted or re-derived by hand; or a
rule that keeps being violated. The same evidence favors improving the existing skill, rule, or
instrument over building a parallel capability.

#### 4c. What knowledge keeps being re-derived?

The same material re-explored, the same lookups repeated, facts re-established every session. Heavy
`webSearches` or `webFetchDomainsTop` on documentation with no docs plugin in attribution is the
classic case. This routes to a project-knowledge destination: a codebase-mapper doc if that plugin
is installed, otherwise `CLAUDE.md`.

#### 4d. Where is the setup pushing back?

Before ordinary friction findings, check whether the project opted into automatic permission learning:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" allowlist --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
```

Until the project opts in, that command only reports what it would add: it considers a fingerprint with at least three user approvals and no user rejection, and never considers a destructive Bash command. Blocked fingerprints are summarized by tool with the most-approved candidates; use `--blocked` for up to 25 detailed entries, which identify an over-broad wildcard rule or the sighted destructive command. Report the safe candidates and offer the opt-in; approving it is what turns on the writing, and every later addition goes to the decision ledger:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" enable-auto-allowlist --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"
```

The marker and every learned rule stay in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`, never a user, global, or shared setting. With no marker, the SessionStart hook exits immediately.

Now the friction: repeated denials on the same safe pattern, corrections clustering on one theme,
tool errors concentrated in one tool, hook errors. Each is real and each has a cheap fix; they just
cap out at restoring the speed the user already expected. Note the difference between
`permission-rule` denials (a rule is too strict, so allowlist the pattern) and `user-rejected`
denials (the user does not want the action at all, so it is a rule about not doing it).

### 5. Route

Map each finding to exactly one destination using [references/routing.md](references/routing.md).
Reuse or extend what already serves the work before selecting a new destination. Choose the least
additional machinery that closes the evidenced gap.

New skills and skill improvements go through **skill-creator**. A hand-rolled SKILL.md tends to
encode the one example in front of you instead of the general shape, and its description ends up
too vague to trigger when it is needed. skill-creator explicitly supports modifying existing skills
and optimizing their trigger descriptions. Prefer improving an existing skill over building a
parallel new one from the same evidence, and show the exact diff for approval. If skill-creator is
not installed, that install is the finding; point the user at the official marketplace and
`/reload-plugins`.

Drop any finding whose fingerprint sits in `decisions.rejected`. The user already said no; do not
re-litigate unless they raise it.

### 6. Propose, one at a time

Seven findings maximum, best first. For each: the evidence, the purpose it serves, the exact command
or diff, and the cost (for plugin installs, `claude plugin details <name>` when context cost is
relevant). Wait for an explicit yes or no unless explicit standing permission covers that exact
class of change. Show each exact change even under standing permission. Never batch-apply.

Best first means value weighted by how well the evidence carries it, not step 4's search order. An
attested measurement gap is the strongest thing you can lead with. An inferred one belongs below the
cheap fixes you are sure of, labelled as inferred so the user can drop it in one line. Then stand by
the order: a list that opens in one ranking and closes in another tells the user you never decided,
and makes them redo the ranking themselves.

Shape the reply so it can be read from the top: the answer in a sentence or two, your read on
purpose, the findings, and then what you looked at and are not proposing. That last part earns its
space, because it says which silences you checked. Without it a short list looks like a shallow pass
instead of a finished one.

If the signals are thin, say so and stop. Proposing nothing is a valid outcome, and inventing work
to look useful is how these passes turn into noise the user learns to skip.

### 7. Record and close

On approval, apply exactly what was shown, then record it. Record rejections too, since that is
what stops the same advice from resurfacing:

```
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" decisions add --project "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}" \
  --title "<short title>" --fingerprint "<kind>:<stable-slug>" --status applied|rejected \
  --kind plugin-install|rule|permission|disable|skill|other \
  --signal denials|interrupts|corrections|toolErrors|any
```

`--signal` is what the next pass verifies against. For a capability no friction counter tracks, use
`any` and say in the title what to look for, so the next pass can ask whether the new skill or
plugin shows up in attribution at all.

Then `node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/quartermaster.js" mark-resupply --project
"${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"` and summarize: what was added, what was declined, and what the next pass
will check.

## Guidelines

- Human in the loop, always. Show each install, uninstall, file edit, or settings change before
  applying it. Require per-item approval unless explicit standing permission covers that exact class.
- Preserve project-required tests, security checks, trust-boundary validation, data-loss protections,
  and accessibility safeguards. Focused checks supplement required gates, never replace them. Follow
  an assigned integration owner's verification split; solo work retains all required verification.
- Rank by the purpose, not by the count. A single missing measurement can outrank thirty denials,
  and a well-attested annoyance that serves no goal is still noise.
- Seven findings maximum. A pass that surfaces thirty gets skimmed; the tools that tried continuous
  suggestion drowned their users.
- Nothing here assumes a codebase. A notes vault, an infrastructure repo, or a writing project has
  standards it cannot check and chores done by hand just as much; only the instruments differ.
- Attribution counts are evidence of use; absence is only a hint. Say "no recorded tool activity in
  the window", never "unused". Hook-only and context-injection plugins legitimately show nothing.
- Improve existing capabilities only where the evidence warrants it. If they hold up, say so;
  there is no minimum improvement count and no automatic unrelated cleanup.
- Quotes and titles are the user's own words back at them. Keep them short and only where they
  carry the finding.
- Every number you cite is the aggregate's number, as it reports it. Rounding a count, attributing a
  command to a session the aggregate never tied it to, or printing a command as run when you inferred
  the answer instead: each one turns a pass the user could check into one they have to trust, and the
  whole value of mining is that they do not have to. If you did not run it, do not show it as run.
