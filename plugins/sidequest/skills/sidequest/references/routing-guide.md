# Routing guide: category-first task matching and legacy complexity grounding

Category routing is the normal path. Read the board's selected routing profile and its effective category rows, match the work against classifier descriptions, stamp the narrowest category, and trust the returned route and `exec` object. Profiles are independent complete category sets. A board pointer selects one profile, then board-local ADD, OVERRIDE, DETACH, or DISABLE rows apply on top. This guide helps choose among effective categories when their descriptions leave genuine ambiguity. It also documents the fixed read-time mapping for tickets that still have only a legacy complexity score.

## Model and effort guidance

From Anthropic's [Choosing the right model](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/choosing-a-model),
[Models overview](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/models/overview), and
[Effort](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/effort):

| Runtime | Useful shape when classification is unclear | Effort guidance |
|---|---|---|
| **haiku** | A tightly specified, mechanical subtask where the executor discovers nothing | No effort parameter |
| **sonnet** | Daily coding work against a known pattern, scoped bugfixes, and one-area features | Usually `high`; `low` fits high-volume or latency-sensitive work |
| **opus** | Multi-file features, shared contracts, cross-cutting refactors, and complex agentic coding | Usually `high`; `xhigh` is the documented starting point for coding and agentic work |
| **fable** | Root-cause investigations, architecture decisions, and work larger than one sitting | Start with `high`; use `xhigh` for model-sensitive work |

Normal category routes, including legacy complexity mapping, top out at `xhigh`. Reserve `max` for
exceptional, genuinely frontier problems. Effort is a category route field, not a second classification
system. The live category description and contract remain authoritative over this general guidance.

## Legacy complexity bands

Complexity is retained for old tickets and for filings where category classification is genuinely
ambiguous. At read time, the fixed bands map to categories:

- **1–3** maps to `coding.easy`.
- **4–6** maps to `coding.normal`.
- **7–10** maps to `coding.hard`.

The mapped category supplies the concrete model, effort, contract, and fallback chain. The mapping is a
read projection only, so it does not rewrite the ticket's stored category. A ticket with neither category
nor complexity remains unclassified and cannot be dispatched until someone classifies and updates it.

## Fallback and dispatch

A category resolves its configured route first when that model is available, then its optional fallback,
then the global routing fallback, then hardwired Sonnet/high. A missing model can therefore produce a
degraded route and warning. The dispatcher does nothing special for that warning: it trusts the `exec`
object from the fresh `list` or `ready` read.

The `exec` projection names the exact executor and concrete model. Claude routes expose `exec.model`; Codex
routes expose a backend-specific `exec.agent` with `exec.model` null, so spawn that exact agent with the
`model` parameter omitted. Inject the category contract verbatim alongside the ticket contract. Never
hand-pick a model or effort after reading the route.

## Per-ticket model requests

A user can name a route for one ticket without changing its classification: set `route: { model, effort }` through MCP `add`/`update` or CLI `--route-model` + `--route-effort`. The override wins only for that ticket's dispatch. Do not edit a category route to satisfy one request, because that silently repoints every later ticket in the category.

An override uses the same route normalization, availability, and provider-boundary checks as dispatch. An unavailable explicit override refuses dispatch rather than falling back, because silently downgrading a user-requested stronger model defeats the request. Fetch its live recipe with `route_recipe({ category, ticket: ref })` or `sidequest route <category> --ticket <ref> --json`; its `route` and agent marker carry the resolved override.

## One-step workflow routing

The `route_recipe` MCP tool and `sidequest route <category> --json` CLI command return the same one-step workflow recipe. Fetch it when the workflow starts, then wire only the `agent` fields into the caller. Never persist a recipe across route edits.

```js
const recipe = await route_recipe({ category });
const result = await Agent({
  model: recipe.agent.model,
  prompt: recipe.agent.promptPrefix + prompt,
});
```

For a Claude route, the recipe keeps the runtime model and an empty prefix:

```json
{"route":{"model":"opus","effort":"high"},"agent":{"model":"opus","promptPrefix":""}}
```

Claude workflow effort follows the session. For a Codex route, the recipe puts the published model id in `agent.model` and leaves `agent.promptPrefix` empty, because the executor definition pins both the model and the effort:

```json
{"route":{"model":"codex-gpt-5-6-terra","effort":"medium"},"agent":{"model":"claude-gpt-5.6-terra[1m]","promptPrefix":""},"effortCarrier":"frontmatter"}
```

`route` is display and provenance data. `agent` is the caller wiring surface. `effortCarrier` says where the effort travels and is the field to read before wiring anything by hand:

- `"frontmatter"` (default) — `agent.model` is the published id the dispatch executor's `model:` frontmatter pins, and its `effort:` frontmatter rides as `output_config.effort`. `promptPrefix` is empty: add no marker, since the gateway gives a marker precedence over `output_config.effort` and it would override the pinned effort.
- `"marker"` — the legacy carriage (`SIDEQUEST_DISPATCH_EFFORT_CARRIER=marker`, for a model-gateway older than 0.53.0). `agent.model` is the virtual `claude-codex-auto` and `agent.promptPrefix` carries the one `[sidequest-route model=... effort=...]` marker. Use exactly that marker, unchanged; never quote it in the prompt or append another.

Codex effort rides in whichever carriage `effortCarrier` names, and nowhere else; Claude effort follows the session. A Codex gateway authentication failure remains a spawn-time error, so report the failed spawn instead of translating the recipe by hand.
