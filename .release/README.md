# Release fragments

`.release/unreleased/` is the queue of changes that have landed but are not published yet. The orchestrator keeps one fragment per integrated ticket and cuts the release from `main` at `HEAD`. The fragment is the repository-owned record of what the board integrated.

`cut.mjs` owns marketplace and plugin version bumps, changelogs, release tags, and fragment consumption, and rolls back its own local commit and tags when a cut fails before anything is pushed and the remote does not already carry the release (`--keep-on-failure` keeps them). Ticket work records the fragment and does not hand-edit plugin or marketplace versions. See [`scripts/release/README.md`](../scripts/release/README.md) for the release lifecycle and recovery steps.

Write one with `node scripts/release/note.mjs`, never by hand if you can avoid it, because the script validates what it writes:

```bash
node scripts/release/note.mjs SQ-843 --title "Build the release engine" --plugins sidequest --bump minor --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
```

## Schema

`.release/unreleased/<REF>.md`, markdown with YAML frontmatter. The filename stem must equal the
`ref` field.

```markdown
---
ref: SQ-843
title: Build deterministic release planning and cut engine
bump: minor
plugins: [sidequest, model-gateway]
commit: c7b2702b2e2f041dff7fe513710de83d89198c55
---
Optional body. It shows up indented under the changelog entry, so use it for the one detail a
reader needs that the title cannot carry.
```

| Field | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ref` | yes | Board ref, matching the filename. `SQ-843`, not `sq-843`. |
| `title` | yes | The changelog line. One line, no control characters. Write it for someone who did not work the ticket. |
| `plugins` | yes | Which published plugins this releases. A list, or a map of plugin to bump level. |
| `bump` | when `plugins` is a list | `patch`, `minor`, or `major`, applied to every plugin in the list. |
| `commit` | no | Integration sha, 7 to 40 hex characters. Becomes the commit link in the changelog. |
| `hold` | no | `true` keeps this fragment out of normal windows and survives the cut. Default `false`. |
| `category` | no | Board category, carried for context. |
| `story` | no | Board story id, carried for context. |
| `body` | n/a | Everything after the closing `---`. Optional. |

Anything else is rejected, so a typo like `plugin:` fails loudly instead of silently releasing
nothing.

`title` has to be a single line. The generated changelog is also the record of what has already
shipped, and a title carrying a newline could write a second entry claiming some other ticket was
released. The body is free-form, but every line of it is indented under the entry, so it cannot
claim anything either.

### Per-plugin bump levels

When one ticket means different things to different plugins, use the map form:

```yaml
plugins:
  sidequest: minor
  model-gateway: patch
```

A `bump` value is still allowed alongside it and acts as the default for any entry left empty.

### Choosing a level

Same criteria the repo has always used, now written down once:

- `patch`: docs, comment fixes, small bug fixes.
- `minor`: new behavior, a new flag, a new failure mode handled.
- `major`: a breaking change to how the plugin is invoked or configured.

A window takes the highest level any fragment asks for per plugin, so thirteen patch fragments
for one plugin produce one patch bump, not thirteen.

### Plugins that are not published

Only plugins listed in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` can appear in a fragment. Something like
`plugins/test-support` has no version and no users, so it never needs one.

## Holding a release

Two switches, either one stops publication:

- `hold: true` in a fragment holds that one change. The rest of the window still ships.
- A `.release/HOLD` file holds the whole window. Its contents are the reason, printed by the cut.
  A hotfix still runs during a HOLD, because an urgent fix has to be able to ship.
