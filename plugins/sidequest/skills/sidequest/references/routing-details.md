# Routing details: category routes and fallback resolution

Read this when you need to explain or debug routing. Category routing is primary: `list` and `ready`
return the selected profile's effective taxonomy plus each ticket's category projection, route, and resolved `exec` object.
Classify from the returned effective taxonomy, stamp the category before claim, then trust the resolved route.
Complexity-only tickets map to fixed category bands at read time. For model and effort guidance when
classification is genuinely ambiguous, see [routing-guide.md](routing-guide.md).

## Routing profiles and category resolution

A routing profile is a complete category set with classifier descriptions, routes, fallbacks, contracts, and enabled state. Profiles are independent. Each board points to one profile, and board-local rows apply on top:

- `ADD` adds a full board-only row. If the selected profile already has that ID, the board row wins and emits an `add-collision` warning.
- `OVERRIDE` patches the selected profile row and keeps its base snapshot for safe recovery.
- `DETACH` pins a full effective row to the board.
- `DISABLE` removes a category for that board, including a future profile addition of the same ID.

Effective categories include provenance such as profile, override, detached, or added. A row based on another profile emits a `foreign-base` warning. Profile edits propagate to boards that point at the profile; local rows remain local. Repointing a board changes its pointer and reports drift. The model-availability fallback is global and remains after category route and category fallback resolution.

Categories are selected from the effective board taxonomy. Use the classifier description to select the narrowest matching category, not a ticket title, urgency, requested model, or copied category table. The route is live: changing a profile or local category re-routes open tickets on their next read.

A present valid category takes precedence over a stored complexity score. A missing category preserves legacy complexity routing. An invalid, deleted, or disabled category resolves through the effective `general` fallback projection with a warning, without rewriting the ticket. A ticket missing both fields must be explicitly classified and updated before claim or dispatch.

The category projection includes its contract text. Inject that text verbatim into the executor prompt
with the ticket contract. The `exec` object remains the dispatch authority. Resolve the category route
when its model is available, then its category fallback, then the global fallback, then hardwired
Sonnet/high. If the read shows a degraded route, do nothing special: trust `exec` from that read.

## Legacy complexity bands

Complexity-only tickets map to categories at read time, without persisting the mapped category:

| Complexity | Category |
| --- | --- |
| 1–3 | `coding.easy` |
| 4–6 | `coding.normal` |
| 7–10 | `coding.hard` |

The mapped category's route and fallback chain provide the concrete model and effort. A ticket with
neither category nor complexity remains unclassified and is not dispatchable until classification.

## Worked example

A fresh read returns this ticket projection:

```json
{
  "ref": "SQ-12",
  "category": { "id": "coding.normal", "route": { "model": "codex-gpt-5-6-terra", "effort": "high" } },
  "model": "codex-gpt-5-6-terra",
  "effort": "high",
  "exec": { "agent": "sidequest-exec-dispatch", "model": null, "backend": "codex" }
}
```

Spawn the exact executor the dispatch returned (`spawn.subagent_type`, recorded as `dispatch.executor`)
with `model` omitted. It is `exec.agent` for a read-write category and `sidequest-exec-dispatch-readonly`
for a readonly one, and it is the only name the board's claim accepts. A degraded route still uses the same dispatch
flow because the read's `exec` projection is authoritative. Another session adopts work by dispatching
the ticket again, which returns a fresh token and current spawn for the stable executor.

## Spawn parameters by route

The main skill's spawn rules, expanded. Every routed spawn goes through the native Agent tool with
the exact executor and spawn object a fresh `dispatch <ref>` returned.

- **Claude routes (`exec.model` non-null):** spawn `exec.agent` with `model: exec.model`,
  `mode: "bypassPermissions"`, and a unique `name`. Sidequest executors are unattended workers;
  omitting bypass sends their ordinary Bash approvals into the lead session. Never spawn a
  Claude-route executor without `model:` — an omitted model inherits the session model (usually the
  priciest route), silently defeating routing. The bundled PreToolUse hook injects or blocks as a
  backstop, but the spawn call must carry it.
- **Codex routes (`exec.model` null):** spawn the EXACT executor the dispatch returned as
  `spawn.subagent_type` with `mode: "bypassPermissions"`, a unique `name`, and the `model`
  parameter OMITTED entirely — `exec.model` is null precisely so you leave it out. Passing ANY
  `model` value (`fable|opus|sonnet|haiku`) overrides the definition's pin and silently runs
  Anthropic instead. Never substitute a generic `sidequest-exec-<effort>` agent for a Codex route —
  the board refuses its claim. Model provenance lives in the gateway route log, the subagent
  transcript, and `done --model`, never in the executor name.

  Which executor you get, and whether a marker rides along, depends on the carriage, and
  `route_recipe`'s `effortCarrier` reports which one is live. Either way the rule for you is the
  same: pass `spawn.subagent_type` and `spawn.prompt` through exactly as dispatch returned them.

  - `effortCarrier: "frontmatter"` (the default) — a per-(model, effort) executor such as
    `sidequest-exec-codex-gpt-5-6-terra-1m-high` (or `sidequest-exec-codex-readonly-...` for a readonly
    category). Its own frontmatter pins the published model id in `model:` and the effort in
    `effort:`, which Claude Code sends as `output_config.effort`, so BOTH halves are already set and
    the spawn carries NO `[sidequest-route ...]` marker. Never add, quote, or echo one: the gateway
    gives a marker precedence over `output_config.effort`, so a stray line would silently override
    the pinned effort. The spawn gate denies a marker on this path. These definitions are written at
    runtime, because external models are discovered at runtime, so they are user-scoped and NOT
    namespaced `sidequest:`.
  - `effortCarrier: "marker"` — the legacy carriage for a model-gateway older than 0.53.0, selected
    by `SIDEQUEST_DISPATCH_EFFORT_CARRIER=marker`. The effort-collapsed `sidequest-exec-dispatch`
    (or `sidequest-exec-dispatch-readonly`) pins the virtual `claude-codex-auto`, and the REAL model
    and effort ride the spawn prompt's `[sidequest-route model=... effort=...]` marker, which the
    codex-gateway shim resolves per request. The marker must reach the spawn prompt intact, and one
    spawn carries exactly one marker (never batch tickets stamped with different models).

  Either way, one spawn carries exactly one route: refuse a batch whose tickets resolve to different
  models or efforts.
- `<effort>` is the ticket's `effort` verbatim from the fresh read, never a level you judge fits
  better: the executor claims with `--effort <baked level>` and the board refuses the claim on a
  mismatch, bouncing the ticket back.
- **Haiku routes:** spawn the stable executor returned in `exec.agent` with
  `model: exec.model`, `mode: "bypassPermissions"`, and a unique `name`, like every other Claude
  route. A plain generic Agent is denied by the Sidequest gate.
- Worktree isolation: tickets with declared files carry `isolation: "worktree"` in `spawn`; pass it
  unchanged. `--shared-tree` / `{sharedTree:true}` is an escape hatch only for a task that depends
  on uncommitted local state, and its reason belongs in a ticket comment before spawning. A bounded
  documentation artifact may close with `done` only when its category has a structured `artifactRoots`
  capability, its one declared scope is under an approved root, it was dispatched with shared-tree enabled,
  and it includes this exact line:
  `Shared-tree artifact mode: leave the generated map as working-tree output; verify, comment, and close with done. Do not commit, submit, push, or edit source.`
  Dispatch pins the artifact authority, approved root, scope, and existing dirty paths. Completion rechecks
  direct real paths and rejects symlinks, junctions, reparse indirection, or newly dirty paths outside scope.
  Marker or contract text alone grants nothing. Every other scoped ticket commits and submits.

## Re-scoring

```bash
sidequest update SQ-8 --complexity 5 --why "wider than scored: it also rewires the reader path"
```

A changed score must arrive with a fresh `--why`; an unmotivated re-score is rejected.
