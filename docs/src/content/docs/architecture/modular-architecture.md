## Maintainer overview

Each plugin can run by itself. Integration uses explicit local files and Claude Code install records so a plugin can discover another plugin without importing its code.

- **Workspace setup:** Quartermaster owns the cross-plugin setup plan for new and existing projects, updates Loadout plugins, and checks workspace health. It reads the Claude Code install registry to resolve installed Loadout instances, so it can cooperate with Observability without making either plugin a dependency of the other.
- **Local observations:** Observability hooks write metadata-only lifecycle observations. Its observer and collector stay on loopback, and the dashboard reads the local store.
- **Model selection:** Model Gateway owns the API boundary. Its shim sends supported gateway model ids to the local proxy and leaves other ids on their normal path.
- **Project context:** Codebase Mapper and Live Rules own their project files and update flows. Other plugins consume their outputs as context instead of reaching into their implementation.
- **Work delivery:** Sidequest owns tickets, stories, categories, routing profiles, dispatch, and executor evidence.

Claude Code records installed plugins in `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`. Quartermaster reads that install registry to find active Loadout instances before checking their freshness.

## Sidequest routing profiles

A profile is a complete routing policy with category rows, descriptions, contracts, routes, and fallbacks. A board points to one profile and can add local rows on top. Resolution applies the board rows, selects the ticket category, then applies the global model-availability fallback.

Profile revisions are audit metadata and do not change executor identity. The Sidequest CLI and MCP expose the profile lifecycle, while the board keeps its profile choice as a pointer instead of copying the profile entries.

User setup and daily workflows belong in the [plugin guides](../../getting-started/). The [generated reference](../../reference/) remains the source for agent-facing command and configuration detail.
