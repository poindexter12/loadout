# Loadout codebase map

Last Updated: 2026-09-08

Loadout is a public Claude Code plugin marketplace. It ships six published plugins, with Sidequest as the largest runtime system and its stable executor roster bundled in the plugin package, plus shared test support, docs, examples, and release automation. The current gateway plugin is Model Gateway. `sandbox/windows/` is a maintainer-only, gitignored Windows Sandbox clean-room harness — not published, not linked from docs.

## How to use and maintain this map

Read this index first, then the smallest linked document that answers the question. Paths and symbols are the source of truth. Refresh the map after structural or workflow changes with `/update-codebase-map`; regenerate documents from current files, update `Last Updated`, and replace `.map-state.json` last with hashes of the exact final bytes.
