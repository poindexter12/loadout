# Running sidequest alongside Jira / Linear / GitHub Issues

Read this when the repo already has an external tracker and you're tempted to skip the board because
the work is "already tracked". Don't — they track different things.

- **The external tracker owns the deliverable.** It's the system-of-record humans read: the story,
  the acceptance criteria, the status the team reports on. You don't replace it, and you usually
  don't file there on the model's behalf.
- **sidequest owns your local execution.** It's the agent's working ledger for *this* session: how
  you cut the external item into parallel-safe pieces, coordinate claims across agents so nothing
  collides, and write spike findings back as comments that outlive your context. None of that belongs
  in Jira, and none of it happens on its own.

How to run both, in practice:

1. Take the external item (e.g. `EXAMPLE-0001`) and, if it's more than a trivial change, **decompose it
   into local sidequest tickets** — one per independent piece, `--file`-scoped, same as any other
   plan. Mirror the external ref in the title so the link is obvious:
   `sidequest add -t "EXAMPLE-0001: document a placeholder change" ...`.
2. **Execute per the normal delegation rules** (main skill) — the presence of a Jira ticket changes
   nothing about how you parallelize or route the work.
3. **Record findings on the sidequest ticket**, not just in the PR — root cause, `file:line`, what
   you ruled out — so a later agent (or you, post-compaction) can pick it up.
4. For a GitHub issue that should track this ticket's delivery, **link it** with the `issue_link`
   MCP tool (or `sidequest issue link <REF> <url|#N>`). Do not leave a `TRACKS <url>` convention
   or manually promise to close it: `sidequest audit --apply` mirrors status only for explicitly
   linked issues and closes them only after release.
5. When the work lands, prepare a sanitized external tracker or PR update. Post it only when an
   existing user or team authorization applies to that public action. Otherwise leave the prepared
   update as a local handoff; sanitation controls content, not posting authority.

GitHub issue bodies, comments, replies, and closure notes you author must stand alone: summarize a
sanitized reproduction, relevant findings, and version, with only publicly resolvable issue, PR,
commit, or release links. Omit local `SQ-`/`US-` identifiers, board slugs, local-only evidence paths,
and board-only references; summarize that evidence directly instead. Keep those references in local
Sidequest threads with the GitHub link back. Preserve reporter text unless you are authorized to edit
it, and do not strip diagnostic error text or hand-edit historical changelogs or generated release
history.

Short version: **Jira says *what* to build; sidequest is *how you execute it* here.** One doesn't
substitute for the other.
